OBJECTIVES: Decreased staffing at nighttime is associated with worse outcomes in 
hospitalized patients. Rapid response teams were developed to decrease
preventable harm by providing additional critical care resources to patients with
clinical deterioration. We sought to determine whether rapid response team call
frequency suffers from decreased utilization at night and how this is associated 
with patient outcomes.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected registry database.
SETTING: National registry database of inpatient rapid response team calls.
PATIENTS: Index rapid response team calls occurring on the general wards in the
American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Medical Emergency Team
database between 2005 and 2015 were analyzed.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was inhospital mortality.
Patient and event characteristics between the hours with the highest and lowest
mortality were compared, and multivariable models adjusting for patient
characteristics were fit. A total of 282,710 rapid response team calls from 274
hospitals were included. The lowest frequency of calls occurred in the
consecutive 1 AM to 6:59 AM period, with 266 of 274 (97%) hospitals having lower 
than expected call volumes during those hours. Mortality was highest during the 7
AM hour and lowest during the noon hour (18.8% vs 13.8%; adjusted odds ratio,
1.41 [1.31-1.52]; p < 0.001). Compared with calls at the noon hour, those during 
the 7 AM hour had more deranged vital signs, were more likely to have a
respiratory trigger, and were more likely to have greater than two simultaneous
triggers.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid response team activation is less frequent during the early
morning and is followed by a spike in mortality in the 7 AM hour. These findings 
suggest that failure to rescue deteriorating patients is more common overnight.
Strategies aimed at improving rapid response team utilization during these
vulnerable hours may improve patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Patients in general medical-surgical wards who experience unplanned
transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) show evidence of physiologic
derangement 6-24h prior to their deterioration. With increasing availability of
electronic medical records (EMRs), automated early warning scores (EWSs) are
becoming feasible.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and performance of an automated EWS based 
on EMR data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a discrete-time logistic regression model to
obtain an hourly risk score to predict unplanned transfer to the ICU within the
next 12h. The model was based on hospitalization episodes from all adult patients
(18years) admitted to 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) hospitals
from 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2013. Eligible patients met these entry criteria: initial 
hospitalization occurred at a KPNC hospital; the hospitalization was not for
childbirth; and the EMR had been operational at the hospital for at least
3months. We evaluated the performance of this risk score, called Advanced Alert
Monitor (AAM) and compared it against two other EWSs (eCART and NEWS) in terms of
their sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive
value, and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (c statistic).
RESULTS: A total of 649,418 hospitalization episodes involving 374,838 patients
met inclusion criteria, with 19,153 of the episodes experiencing at least one
outcome. The analysis data set had 48,723,248 hourly observations. Predictors
included physiologic data (laboratory tests and vital signs); neurological
status; severity of illness and longitudinal comorbidity indices; care
directives; and health services indicators (e.g. elapsed length of stay). AAM
showed better performance compared to NEWS and eCART in all the metrics and
prediction intervals. The AAM AUC was 0.82 compared to 0.79 and 0.76 for eCART
and NEWS, respectively. Using a threshold that generated 1 alert per day in a
unit with a patient census of 35, the sensitivity of AAM was 49% (95% CI:
47.6-50.3%) compared to the sensitivities of eCART and NEWS scores of 44%
(42.3-45.1) and 40% (38.2-40.9), respectively. For all three scores, about half
of alerts occurred within 12h of the event, and almost two thirds within 24h of
the event.
CONCLUSION: The AAM score is an example of a score that takes advantage of
multiple data streams now available in modern EMRs. It highlights the ability to 
harness complex algorithms to maximize signal extraction. The main challenge in
the future is to develop detection approaches for patients in whom data are
sparser because their baseline risk is lower.

Sepsis contributes to up to half of all deaths in hospitalized patients, and
early interventions, such as appropriate antibiotics, have been shown to improve 
outcomes. Most research has focused on early identification and treatment of
patients with sepsis in the ED and the ICU; however, many patients acquire sepsis
on the general wards. The goal of this review is to discuss recent advances in
the detection of sepsis in patients on the hospital wards. We discuss data
highlighting the benefits and limitations of the systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS) criteria for screening patients with sepsis, such as its low
specificity, as well as newly described scoring systems, including the proposed
role of the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score.
Challenges specific to detecting sepsis on the wards are discussed, and future
directions that use big data approaches and automated alert systems are
highlighted.

BACKGROUND: Patients in general medical-surgical wards who experience unplanned
transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) show evidence of physiologic
derangement 6-24h prior to their deterioration. With increasing availability of
electronic medical records (EMRs), automated early warning scores (EWSs) are
becoming feasible.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and performance of an automated EWS based 
on EMR data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a discrete-time logistic regression model to
obtain an hourly risk score to predict unplanned transfer to the ICU within the
next 12h. The model was based on hospitalization episodes from all adult patients
(18years) admitted to 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) hospitals
from 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2013. Eligible patients met these entry criteria: initial 
hospitalization occurred at a KPNC hospital; the hospitalization was not for
childbirth; and the EMR had been operational at the hospital for at least
3months. We evaluated the performance of this risk score, called Advanced Alert
Monitor (AAM) and compared it against two other EWSs (eCART and NEWS) in terms of
their sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive
value, and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (c statistic).
RESULTS: A total of 649,418 hospitalization episodes involving 374,838 patients
met inclusion criteria, with 19,153 of the episodes experiencing at least one
outcome. The analysis data set had 48,723,248 hourly observations. Predictors
included physiologic data (laboratory tests and vital signs); neurological
status; severity of illness and longitudinal comorbidity indices; care
directives; and health services indicators (e.g. elapsed length of stay). AAM
showed better performance compared to NEWS and eCART in all the metrics and
prediction intervals. The AAM AUC was 0.82 compared to 0.79 and 0.76 for eCART
and NEWS, respectively. Using a threshold that generated 1 alert per day in a
unit with a patient census of 35, the sensitivity of AAM was 49% (95% CI:
47.6-50.3%) compared to the sensitivities of eCART and NEWS scores of 44%
(42.3-45.1) and 40% (38.2-40.9), respectively. For all three scores, about half
of alerts occurred within 12h of the event, and almost two thirds within 24h of
the event.
CONCLUSION: The AAM score is an example of a score that takes advantage of
multiple data streams now available in modern EMRs. It highlights the ability to 
harness complex algorithms to maximize signal extraction. The main challenge in
the future is to develop detection approaches for patients in whom data are
sparser because their baseline risk is lower.

Sepsis contributes to up to half of all deaths in hospitalized patients, and
early interventions, such as appropriate antibiotics, have been shown to improve 
outcomes. Most research has focused on early identification and treatment of
patients with sepsis in the ED and the ICU; however, many patients acquire sepsis
on the general wards. The goal of this review is to discuss recent advances in
the detection of sepsis in patients on the hospital wards. We discuss data
highlighting the benefits and limitations of the systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS) criteria for screening patients with sepsis, such as its low
specificity, as well as newly described scoring systems, including the proposed
role of the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score.
Challenges specific to detecting sepsis on the wards are discussed, and future
directions that use big data approaches and automated alert systems are
highlighted.

OBJECTIVES: Decreased staffing at nighttime is associated with worse outcomes in 
hospitalized patients. Rapid response teams were developed to decrease
preventable harm by providing additional critical care resources to patients with
clinical deterioration. We sought to determine whether rapid response team call
frequency suffers from decreased utilization at night and how this is associated 
with patient outcomes.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected registry database.
SETTING: National registry database of inpatient rapid response team calls.
PATIENTS: Index rapid response team calls occurring on the general wards in the
American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Medical Emergency Team
database between 2005 and 2015 were analyzed.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was inhospital mortality.
Patient and event characteristics between the hours with the highest and lowest
mortality were compared, and multivariable models adjusting for patient
characteristics were fit. A total of 282,710 rapid response team calls from 274
hospitals were included. The lowest frequency of calls occurred in the
consecutive 1 AM to 6:59 AM period, with 266 of 274 (97%) hospitals having lower 
than expected call volumes during those hours. Mortality was highest during the 7
AM hour and lowest during the noon hour (18.8% vs 13.8%; adjusted odds ratio,
1.41 [1.31-1.52]; p < 0.001). Compared with calls at the noon hour, those during 
the 7 AM hour had more deranged vital signs, were more likely to have a
respiratory trigger, and were more likely to have greater than two simultaneous
triggers.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid response team activation is less frequent during the early
morning and is followed by a spike in mortality in the 7 AM hour. These findings 
suggest that failure to rescue deteriorating patients is more common overnight.
Strategies aimed at improving rapid response team utilization during these
vulnerable hours may improve patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of second malignant neoplasm (SMN) within the first ten
years of diagnosis in high-risk neuroblastoma patients treated with modern,
intensive therapy is unknown. Further, the underlying germline genetics that
contribute to SMN in these survivors are not known.
METHODS: The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) database of patients
diagnosed from 1990 to 2010 was analysed. SMN risk was accessed by cumulative
incidence, standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risk. A
candidate gene-based association study evaluated genetic susceptibility to SMN in
neuroblastoma survivors.
RESULTS: Of the 5987 patients in the INRG database with SMN data enrolled in a
clinical trial, 43 (0.72%) developed a SMN. The 10-year cumulative incidence of
SMN for high-risk patients was 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-2.6%)
compared with 0.38% (95% CI: 0.22-0.94%) for low-risk patients (P = 0.01).
High-risk patients had an almost 18-fold higher incidence of SMN compared to age-
and sex-matched controls (SIR = 17.5 (95% CI: 11.4-25.3), absolute excess
risk = 27.6). For patients treated on high- and intermediate-risk clinical
trials, the SIR of acute myelogenous leukaemia was 106.8 (95% CI: 28.7-273.4) and
127.7 (95%CI: 25.7-373.3), respectively. Variants implicating DNA repair genes
XRCC3 (rs861539: P = 0.006; odds ratio: 2.04, 95%CI: 1.19-3.46) and MSH2
(rs17036651: P = 0.009; odds ratio: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08-0.81) were associated with
SMN.
CONCLUSION: The intensive multi-modality treatment strategy currently used to
treat high-risk neuroblastoma is associated with a significantly increased risk
of secondary acute myelogenous leukaemia. Defining the interactions of treatment 
exposures and genetic factors that promote the development of SMN is critical for
optimising survivorship care.

Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer with remarkably divergent tumour behaviour
and the presence of metastatic disease is a powerful predictor of adverse
outcome. However, the importance of the involvement of specific metastatic sites 
or overall metastatic burden in determining outcome has not been fully explored. 
We analysed data from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group database for
2250 patients with stage 4 disease treated from 1990 to 2002. Metastatic burden
was assessed using a 'metastatic site index' (MSI), a score based on the number
of metastatic systems involved. Overall, involvement of bone marrow, bone, lung, 
central nervous system, or other sites was associated with worse outcome. For
patients aged ≥18 months, involvement of liver had the greatest impact on outcome
and was associated with tumour MYCN amplification and adrenal primary and lung
metastases. Increased MSI was associated with worse outcome and higher baseline
ferritin/lactate dehydrogenase. We explored the impact of initial treatment
approach on these associations. Limiting the analysis to patients allocated to
protocols including stem cell transplant (SCT), there was no longer an
association of outcome with metastatic involvement of any individual system or
increasing MSI. Thus, treatment escalation with SCT (and the addition of
differentiating agents to maintenance therapy) appears to have provided maximal
benefit to patients with greatest metastatic disease burden. These findings
underscore the importance of examining prognostic factors in the context of
specific treatments since the addition of new therapies may change or even negate
the predictive impact of a particular variable.

BACKGROUND: Myeloablative therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma commonly includes
melphalan. Increased cellular glutathione (GSH) can mediate melphalan resistance.
Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH synthesis inhibitor, enhances melphalan
activity against neuroblastoma cell lines, providing the rationale for a Phase 1 
trial of BSO-melphalan.
PROCEDURES: Patients with recurrent/resistant high-risk neuroblastoma received
BSO (3 gram/m(2) bolus, then 24 grams/m(2) /day infusion days -4 to -2), with
escalating doses of intravenous melphalan (20-125 mg/m(2) ) days -3 and -2, and
autologous stem cells day 0 using 3 + 3 dose escalation.
RESULTS: Among 28 patients evaluable for dose escalation, one dose-limiting
toxicity occurred at 20 mg/m(2) melphalan (grade 3 aspartate
aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase) and one at 80 mg/m(2) (streptococcal
bacteremia, grade 4 hypotension/pulmonary/hypocalcemia) without sequelae. Among
25 patients evaluable for response, there was one partial response (PR) and two
mixed responses (MRs) among eight patients with prior melphalan exposure; one PR 
and three MRs among 16 patients without prior melphalan; one stable disease with 
unknown melphalan history. Melphalan pharmacokinetics with BSO were similar to
reports for melphalan alone. Melphalan Cmax for most patients was below the 10 μM
concentration that showed neuroblastoma preclinical activity with BSO.
CONCLUSIONS: BSO (75 gram/m(2) ) with melphalan (125 mg/m(2) ) is tolerable with 
stem cell support and active in recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma. Further dose 
escalation is feasible and may increase responses.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of second malignant neoplasm (SMN) within the first ten
years of diagnosis in high-risk neuroblastoma patients treated with modern,
intensive therapy is unknown. Further, the underlying germline genetics that
contribute to SMN in these survivors are not known.
METHODS: The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) database of patients
diagnosed from 1990 to 2010 was analysed. SMN risk was accessed by cumulative
incidence, standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risk. A
candidate gene-based association study evaluated genetic susceptibility to SMN in
neuroblastoma survivors.
RESULTS: Of the 5987 patients in the INRG database with SMN data enrolled in a
clinical trial, 43 (0.72%) developed a SMN. The 10-year cumulative incidence of
SMN for high-risk patients was 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-2.6%)
compared with 0.38% (95% CI: 0.22-0.94%) for low-risk patients (P = 0.01).
High-risk patients had an almost 18-fold higher incidence of SMN compared to age-
and sex-matched controls (SIR = 17.5 (95% CI: 11.4-25.3), absolute excess
risk = 27.6). For patients treated on high- and intermediate-risk clinical
trials, the SIR of acute myelogenous leukaemia was 106.8 (95% CI: 28.7-273.4) and
127.7 (95%CI: 25.7-373.3), respectively. Variants implicating DNA repair genes
XRCC3 (rs861539: P = 0.006; odds ratio: 2.04, 95%CI: 1.19-3.46) and MSH2
(rs17036651: P = 0.009; odds ratio: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08-0.81) were associated with
SMN.
CONCLUSION: The intensive multi-modality treatment strategy currently used to
treat high-risk neuroblastoma is associated with a significantly increased risk
of secondary acute myelogenous leukaemia. Defining the interactions of treatment 
exposures and genetic factors that promote the development of SMN is critical for
optimising survivorship care.

Accumulating evidence has supported the fallopian tube rather than the ovary as
the origin for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). To understand the
relationship between putative precursor lesions and metastatic tumors, we
performed whole-exome sequencing on specimens from eight HGSOC patient
progression series consisting of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC), 
invasive fallopian tube lesions, invasive ovarian lesions, and omental
metastases. Integration of copy number and somatic mutations revealed
patient-specific patterns with similar mutational signatures and copy-number
variation profiles across all anatomic sites, suggesting that genomic instability
is an early event in HGSOC. Phylogenetic analyses supported STIC as precursor
lesions in half of our patient cohort, but also identified STIC as metastases in 
2 patients. Ex vivo assays revealed that HGSOC spheroids can implant in the
fallopian tube epithelium and mimic STIC lesions. That STIC may represent
metastases calls into question the assumption that STIC are always indicative of 
primary fallopian tube cancers.SIGNIFICANCE: We find that the putative precursor 
lesions for HGSOC, STIC, possess most of the genomic aberrations present in
advanced cancers. In addition, a proportion of STIC represent intraepithelial
metastases to the fallopian tube rather than the origin of HGSOC. Cancer Discov;

Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer with remarkably divergent tumour behaviour
and the presence of metastatic disease is a powerful predictor of adverse
outcome. However, the importance of the involvement of specific metastatic sites 
or overall metastatic burden in determining outcome has not been fully explored. 
We analysed data from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group database for
2250 patients with stage 4 disease treated from 1990 to 2002. Metastatic burden
was assessed using a 'metastatic site index' (MSI), a score based on the number
of metastatic systems involved. Overall, involvement of bone marrow, bone, lung, 
central nervous system, or other sites was associated with worse outcome. For
patients aged ≥18 months, involvement of liver had the greatest impact on outcome
and was associated with tumour MYCN amplification and adrenal primary and lung
metastases. Increased MSI was associated with worse outcome and higher baseline
ferritin/lactate dehydrogenase. We explored the impact of initial treatment
approach on these associations. Limiting the analysis to patients allocated to
protocols including stem cell transplant (SCT), there was no longer an
association of outcome with metastatic involvement of any individual system or
increasing MSI. Thus, treatment escalation with SCT (and the addition of
differentiating agents to maintenance therapy) appears to have provided maximal
benefit to patients with greatest metastatic disease burden. These findings
underscore the importance of examining prognostic factors in the context of
specific treatments since the addition of new therapies may change or even negate
the predictive impact of a particular variable.

BACKGROUND: Myeloablative therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma commonly includes
melphalan. Increased cellular glutathione (GSH) can mediate melphalan resistance.
Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH synthesis inhibitor, enhances melphalan
activity against neuroblastoma cell lines, providing the rationale for a Phase 1 
trial of BSO-melphalan.
PROCEDURES: Patients with recurrent/resistant high-risk neuroblastoma received
BSO (3 gram/m(2) bolus, then 24 grams/m(2) /day infusion days -4 to -2), with
escalating doses of intravenous melphalan (20-125 mg/m(2) ) days -3 and -2, and
autologous stem cells day 0 using 3 + 3 dose escalation.
RESULTS: Among 28 patients evaluable for dose escalation, one dose-limiting
toxicity occurred at 20 mg/m(2) melphalan (grade 3 aspartate
aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase) and one at 80 mg/m(2) (streptococcal
bacteremia, grade 4 hypotension/pulmonary/hypocalcemia) without sequelae. Among
25 patients evaluable for response, there was one partial response (PR) and two
mixed responses (MRs) among eight patients with prior melphalan exposure; one PR 
and three MRs among 16 patients without prior melphalan; one stable disease with 
unknown melphalan history. Melphalan pharmacokinetics with BSO were similar to
reports for melphalan alone. Melphalan Cmax for most patients was below the 10 μM
concentration that showed neuroblastoma preclinical activity with BSO.
CONCLUSIONS: BSO (75 gram/m(2) ) with melphalan (125 mg/m(2) ) is tolerable with 
stem cell support and active in recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma. Further dose 
escalation is feasible and may increase responses.

Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer with remarkably divergent tumour behaviour
and the presence of metastatic disease is a powerful predictor of adverse
outcome. However, the importance of the involvement of specific metastatic sites 
or overall metastatic burden in determining outcome has not been fully explored. 
We analysed data from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group database for
2250 patients with stage 4 disease treated from 1990 to 2002. Metastatic burden
was assessed using a 'metastatic site index' (MSI), a score based on the number
of metastatic systems involved. Overall, involvement of bone marrow, bone, lung, 
central nervous system, or other sites was associated with worse outcome. For
patients aged ≥18 months, involvement of liver had the greatest impact on outcome
and was associated with tumour MYCN amplification and adrenal primary and lung
metastases. Increased MSI was associated with worse outcome and higher baseline
ferritin/lactate dehydrogenase. We explored the impact of initial treatment
approach on these associations. Limiting the analysis to patients allocated to
protocols including stem cell transplant (SCT), there was no longer an
association of outcome with metastatic involvement of any individual system or
increasing MSI. Thus, treatment escalation with SCT (and the addition of
differentiating agents to maintenance therapy) appears to have provided maximal
benefit to patients with greatest metastatic disease burden. These findings
underscore the importance of examining prognostic factors in the context of
specific treatments since the addition of new therapies may change or even negate
the predictive impact of a particular variable.

BACKGROUND: Myeloablative therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma commonly includes
melphalan. Increased cellular glutathione (GSH) can mediate melphalan resistance.
Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH synthesis inhibitor, enhances melphalan
activity against neuroblastoma cell lines, providing the rationale for a Phase 1 
trial of BSO-melphalan.
PROCEDURES: Patients with recurrent/resistant high-risk neuroblastoma received
BSO (3 gram/m(2) bolus, then 24 grams/m(2) /day infusion days -4 to -2), with
escalating doses of intravenous melphalan (20-125 mg/m(2) ) days -3 and -2, and
autologous stem cells day 0 using 3 + 3 dose escalation.
RESULTS: Among 28 patients evaluable for dose escalation, one dose-limiting
toxicity occurred at 20 mg/m(2) melphalan (grade 3 aspartate
aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase) and one at 80 mg/m(2) (streptococcal
bacteremia, grade 4 hypotension/pulmonary/hypocalcemia) without sequelae. Among
25 patients evaluable for response, there was one partial response (PR) and two
mixed responses (MRs) among eight patients with prior melphalan exposure; one PR 
and three MRs among 16 patients without prior melphalan; one stable disease with 
unknown melphalan history. Melphalan pharmacokinetics with BSO were similar to
reports for melphalan alone. Melphalan Cmax for most patients was below the 10 μM
concentration that showed neuroblastoma preclinical activity with BSO.
CONCLUSIONS: BSO (75 gram/m(2) ) with melphalan (125 mg/m(2) ) is tolerable with 
stem cell support and active in recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma. Further dose 
escalation is feasible and may increase responses.

Our understanding of gene expression has come far since the 'one-gene
one-polypeptide' hypothesis proposed by Beadle and Tatum. In this review, we
address the gradual recognition that a growing number of polycistronic genes,
originally discovered in viruses, are being identified within the mammalian
genome, and that these may provide new insights into disease mechanisms and
treatment. We carried out a systematic literature review identifying 13 mammalian
genes for which there is evidence for polycistronic expression via translation
through an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Although the canonical mechanism 
of translation initiation has been studied extensively, here we highlight a
process of noncanonical translation, IRES-mediated translation, that is a growing
source for understanding complex inheritance, the elucidation of disease
mechanisms, and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Identification of
additional polycistronic genes may provide new insights into disease therapy and 
allow for new discoveries of both translational and disease mechanisms.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
disease characterized by slowly progressive ataxia and Purkinje cell
degeneration. SCA6 is caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion within a second 
CACNA1A gene product, α1ACT. α1ACT expression is under the control of an internal
ribosomal entry site (IRES) present within the CACNA1A coding region. Whereas
SCA6 allele knock-in mice show indistinguishable phenotypes from wild-type
littermates, expression of SCA6-associated α1ACT (α1ACTSCA6) driven by a Purkinje
cell-specific promoter in mice produces slowly progressive ataxia and cerebellar 
atrophy. We developed an early-onset SCA6 mouse model using an adeno-associated
virus (AAV)-based gene delivery system to ectopically express CACNA1A IRES-driven
α1ACTSCA6 to test the potential of CACNA1A IRES-targeting therapies. Mice
expressing AAV9-mediated CACNA1A IRES-driven α1ACTSCA6 exhibited early-onset
ataxia, motor deficits, and Purkinje cell degeneration. We identified miR-3191-5p
as a microRNA (miRNA) that targeted CACNA1A IRES and preferentially inhibited the
CACNA1A IRES-driven translation of α1ACT in an Argonaute 4 (Ago4)-dependent
manner. We found that eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), eIF4AII and eIF4GII, 
interacted with the CACNA1A IRES to enhance α1ACT translation. Ago4-bound
miR-3191-5p blocked the interaction of eIF4AII and eIF4GII with the CACNA1A IRES,
attenuating IRES-driven α1ACT translation. Furthermore, AAV9-mediated delivery of
miR-3191-5p protected mice from the ataxia, motor deficits, and Purkinje cell
degeneration caused by CACNA1A IRES-driven α1ACTSCA6 We have established proof of
principle that viral delivery of an miRNA can rescue a disease phenotype through 
modulation of cellular IRES activity in a mouse model.

Friedreich ataxia is a progressive degenerative disease with neurologic and
cardiac involvement. This study characterizes comorbid medical conditions in a
large cohort of patients with Friedreich ataxia. Patient diagnoses were collected
in a large natural history study of 641 subjects. Prevalence of diagnoses in the 
cohort with Friedreich ataxia was compared with prevalence in the population
without Friedreich ataxia. Ten patients (1.6%) had inflammatory bowel disease,
3.5 times more common in this cohort of individuals with Friedreich ataxia than
in the general population. Four subjects were growth hormone deficient,
reflecting a prevalence in Friedreich ataxia that is 28 times greater than the
general population. The present study identifies specific diagnoses not
traditionally associated with Friedreich ataxia that are found at higher
frequency in this disease. These associations could represent coincidence, shared
genetic background, or potentially interactive disease mechanisms with Friedreich
ataxia.

Consensus definitions have been reached for both acute kidney injury (AKI) and
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and these definitions are now routinely used in
research and clinical practice. The KDIGO guideline defines AKI as an abrupt
decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or less, whereas CKD is defined
by the persistence of kidney disease for a period of >90 days. AKI and CKD are
increasingly recognized as related entities and in some instances probably
represent a continuum of the disease process. For patients in whom
pathophysiologic processes are ongoing, the term acute kidney disease (AKD) has
been proposed to define the course of disease after AKI; however, definitions of 
AKD and strategies for the management of patients with AKD are not currently
available. In this consensus statement, the Acute Disease Quality Initiative
(ADQI) proposes definitions, staging criteria for AKD, and strategies for the
management of affected patients. We also make recommendations for areas of future
research, which aim to improve understanding of the underlying processes and
improve outcomes for patients with AKD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The kidney, like most other organs, has a reserve capacity
that can be utilized in times of increased physiologic demand. The ability to
quantify this renal reserve function across various parts of the nephron
(glomerular and tubular) has been an area of increased investigation over the
past several years. In this review, we discuss several techniques that have been 
developed to interrogate the maximal physiologic capacity of the injured kidney.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although protein loading has been established as an ideal method
to investigate glomerular filtration capacity in healthy kidneys, other methods
such as the antagonism of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have
demonstrated promise as a method to determine underlying glomerular disease in
those with acute kidney injury and other comorbidities (e.g., congestive heart
failure and chronic kidney disease). The furosemide stress test has been
demonstrated to be a useful clinical tool to ascertain tubular integrity in the
setting of acute kidney injury.
SUMMARY: Although various methods to interrogate the reserve capacity of the
several nephron segments (glomerulus and tubules) have been investigated, none of
these techniques have had wide-spread clinical implementation. Further research
into acute kidney injury stress testing is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Identification of acute kidney injury (AKI) can be challenging in
patients with underlying chronic disease, and biomarkers often perform poorly in 
this population. In this study we examined the performance characteristics of the
novel biomarker panel of urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2)
and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 ([IGFBP7]) in patients with a
variety of comorbid conditions.
METHODS: We analyzed data from two multicenter studies of critically ill patients
in which [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] was validated for prediction of Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Stage 2 or 3 AKI within 12 h. We constructed
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for AKI prediction both overall
and by comorbid conditions common among patients with AKI, including diabetes
mellitus, congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
RESULTS: In the overall cohort of 1131 patients, 139 (12.3%) developed KDIGO
Stage 2 or 3 AKI. [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] was significantly higher in AKI versus non-AKI
patients, both overall and within each comorbidity subgroup. The AUC for
[TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] in predicting AKI was 0.81 overall. Higher AUC was noted in
patients with versus without CHF (0.89 versus 0.79; P = 0.026) and CKD (0.91
versus 0.80; P = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed no significant impairment in the performance of cell
cycle arrest biomarkers due to the presence of chronic comorbid conditions.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication that is associated
with several adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients. AKI significantly
increases the risk of mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, and
intensive care admission, and it also has serious economic ramifications.
Effective risk stratification to identify patients at risk for severe AKI is
essential for targeting our health care and research resources to tackle this
important public health issue. The overwhelming majority of research in earlier
diagnosis and risk stratification of AKI over the past 10 years has focused on
novel biomarker development. The purpose of this review is to provide an update
on other novel risk stratification tools than can be used in the prognostication 
of AKI. We discuss the utility of the furosemide stress test in predicting the
severity of AKI and the renal angina index in predicting the occurrence of AKI.
We also discuss NephroCheck, a prognostic test that measures tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 for the
early detection of severe AKI.

Despite the rapidly increasing prevalence of obesity in the transplant
population, the optimal management of obese liver transplant candidates remains
undefined. Setting strict body mass index cutoffs for transplant candidacy
remains controversial, with limited data to guide this practice. Body mass index 
is an imperfect measure of surgical risk in this population, partly due to volume
overload and variable visceral adiposity. Weight loss before transplantation may 
be beneficial, but it remains important to avoid protein calorie malnutrition and
sarcopenia. Intensive lifestyle modifications appear to be successful in
achieving weight loss, though the durability of these interventions is not known.
Pretransplant and intraoperative bariatric surgeries have been performed, but
large randomized controlled trials are lacking. Traditional cardiovascular
comorbidities are more prevalent in obese individuals and remain the basis for
pretransplant cardiovascular evaluation and risk stratification. The recent US
liver transplant experience demonstrates comparable patient and graft survival
between obese and nonobese liver transplant recipients, but obesity presents
important medical and surgical challenges during and after transplant.
Specifically, obesity is associated with an increased incidence of wound
infections, wound dehiscence, biliary complications and overall infection, and
confers a higher risk of posttransplant obesity and metabolic syndrome-related
complications. In this review, we examine current practices in the obese liver
transplant population, offer recommendations based on the currently available
data, and highlight areas where additional research is needed.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) is associated
with worse outcomes. The combination of ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) has
been approved for HCV treatment after LT, but there are limited data on the
effectiveness and safety of LDV/SOF in the ""real-world"" setting. This multicenter
study is the largest report to date on the effectiveness and safety of LDV/SOF in
the post-LT setting. A total of 204 patients (72% male, 68% Caucasian, 66%
genotype [GT] 1a, 21% METAVIR F3-F4, 49% treatment-experienced) were treated with
LDV/SOF. The mean duration from LT to treatment initiation was 4.8 years. The
overall sustained virological response rate 12 weeks after completion of therapy 
(SVR12) was 96%. Patients treated with 8 or 12 weeks of LDV/SOF without RBV
experienced an SVR12 rate of 100% and 96%, respectively. Calcineurin inhibitors
were used in 89% of patients, and 32% of patients underwent adjustment in
immunosuppression during treatment. One episode of mild rejection, responsive to 
an increase in immunosuppression dosage, was observed. There was no graft loss
attributed to HCV treatment. Four deaths occurred unrelated to HCV treatment, and
no significant serious adverse events were documented. In conclusion, SOF and LDV
with or without RBV for 8, 12, or 24 weeks in post-LT patients was effective and 
safe with a high SVR12 rate across a spectrum of GTs and stages of fibrosis.

BACKGROUND: While the effects of rifaximin have been shown to be protective
against acute kidney injury (AKI) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) in
alcohol-induced cirrhosis, its long-term effects on the renal function of other
cirrhotic patients are unknown.
AIM: To examine the long-term effects of rifaximin on the renal function of
patients with cirrhosis from various etiologies.
METHODS: In a retrospective study, we examined cirrhotic patients at the
University of Chicago Liver Clinic from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014.
The study enrolled patients on rifaximin for ≥90 days, who were then matched by
age, gender, and MELD score to a control group. Patients with malignancy and
renal replacement therapy (RRT) at baseline were excluded. Data were censored at 
the last follow-up, termination of rifaximin therapy, initiation of RRT, death,
or liver transplant.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight rifaximin cases were identified and matched to 88 control
cases. Baseline characteristics were similar, with the exceptions of more
prevalent long-term midodrine use (≥90 days) (17.0 vs 4.5 %, p = 0.01) and
baseline ascites (37.5 vs 23.8 %, p = 0.05) in the rifaximin group. There was no 
difference in the frequency of infections, deaths, liver transplants, or
hospitalizations. After controlling for cofounders, the incidence rate ratio of
AKI (IRR 0.71, p = 0.02) and HRS (IRR 0.21, p = 0.02), as well as the risk of
requiring RRT (OR 0.23, p = 0.01), was lower in the rifaximin group.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use of rifaximin is associated with a decrease incidence
of AKI and HRS and a decrease risk of requiring RRT in a general population of
cirrhotic patients.

There is an increasing burden of chronic liver disease (CLD) in the United States
but a significant shortage of hepatologists. Thus, it is necessary to develop new
recruitment strategies to the field of hepatology as well as ensure that
non-gastroenterology-trained physicians are able to capably assist in the care of
CLD. We established a novel, nonelective, inpatient hepatology rotation that uses
required modules in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases
Curriculum and Training-First Hepatitis B and C curriculums as well as in
LiverLearning. A paper-based anonymous assessment was distributed to the
inaugural 25 postgraduate years 2 and 3 internal medicine residents before and
after the 2-week rotation over the course of 1 year. Both the prerotation and
postrotation assessments included validated multiple-choice questions and
Likert-type questions, which evaluated self-perceived knowledge and comfort with 
managing CLD. The mean comfort level (1 = not at all comfortable/strongly
disagree, 5 = very comfortable/strongly agree) of managing several common liver
diseases increased significantly after completion of the rotation (i.e.,
cirrhosis 2.8 versus 3.8, P < 0.001; hepatitis B 2.4 versus 3.4, P = 0.001;
hepatitis C 2.6 versus 3.7, P = 0.002; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 3.0 versus
4.0, P < 0.001; liver transplant care 2.1 versus 3.4, P < 0.001). There was also 
a significantly increased interest in hepatology as a career (2.6 versus 3.0, P =
0.03). Finally, the mean percentage of multiple-choice questions answered
correctly on the pretest was 62% and posttest was 77% (P = 0.02).CONCLUSION: Our 
novel curriculum and nonelective hepatology rotation has effectively demonstrated
improvement in internal medicine residents' comfort with and knowledge of CLD,
and increased career interest in hepatology was also observed after completion of
the curriculum, which suggests that more exposure to CLD could positively impact 
recruitment to the workforce; larger, multicenter studies are needed to validate 
these results. (Hepatology 2016;64:2210-2218).

Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most commonly
inherited kidney disease, and the fourth most common cause of end-stage renal
disease. ADPKD is a systemic disorder, associated with numerous extrarenal
manifestations, including polycystic liver disease, the most common
gastrointestinal manifestation, and diverticular disease, inguinal, and ventral
hernias, pancreatic cysts, and large bile duct abnormalities. All of these
gastrointestinal manifestations play a significant role in disease burden in
ADPKD, particularly in the later decades of life. Thus, as ADPKD becomes more
recognized, it is important for gastroenterologists to be knowledgeable of this
monogenic disorder's effects on the digestive system.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) can be difficult to control, particularly in some
African-Americans. When standard therapy of prednisone and azathioprine is
ineffective or poorly tolerated, alternative therapies are resorted to. We report
two patients with AIH who were refractory to or intolerant of standard therapy.
They initially responded to a combination of tacrolimus and MMF, but eventually
developed acute flares of the disease that had to be managed with sirolimus, and 
in one case, rituximab, to achieve remission.

Despite the rapidly increasing prevalence of obesity in the transplant
population, the optimal management of obese liver transplant candidates remains
undefined. Setting strict body mass index cutoffs for transplant candidacy
remains controversial, with limited data to guide this practice. Body mass index 
is an imperfect measure of surgical risk in this population, partly due to volume
overload and variable visceral adiposity. Weight loss before transplantation may 
be beneficial, but it remains important to avoid protein calorie malnutrition and
sarcopenia. Intensive lifestyle modifications appear to be successful in
achieving weight loss, though the durability of these interventions is not known.
Pretransplant and intraoperative bariatric surgeries have been performed, but

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) can be difficult to control, particularly in some
African-Americans. When standard therapy of prednisone and azathioprine is
ineffective or poorly tolerated, alternative therapies are resorted to. We report
two patients with AIH who were refractory to or intolerant of standard therapy.
They initially responded to a combination of tacrolimus and MMF, but eventually
developed acute flares of the disease that had to be managed with sirolimus, and 
in one case, rituximab, to achieve remission.

OBJECTIVE: This article presents and describes our methods in developing a novel 
strategy for recruitment of underrepresented, community-based participants, for
pragmatic research studies leveraging routinely collected electronic health
record (EHR) data.
METHODS: We designed a new approach for recruiting eligible patients from the
community, while also leveraging affiliated health systems to extract clinical
data for community participants. The strategy involves methods for data
collection, linkage, and tracking. In this workflow, potential participants are
identified in the community and surveyed regarding eligibility. These data are
then encrypted and deidentified via a hashing algorithm for linkage of the
community participant back to a record at a clinical site. The linkage allows for
eligibility verification and automated follow-up. Longitudinal data are collected
by querying the EHR data and surveying the community participant directly. We
discuss this strategy within the context of two national research projects, a
clinical trial and an observational cohort study.
CONCLUSION: The community-based recruitment strategy is a novel, low-touch,
clinical trial enrollment method to engage a diverse set of participants. Direct 
outreach to community participants, while utilizing EHR data for clinical
information and follow-up, allows for efficient recruitment and follow-up
strategies. This new strategy for recruitment links data reported from community 
participants to clinical data in the EHR and allows for eligibility verification 
and automated follow-up. The workflow has the potential to improve recruitment
efficiency and engage traditionally underrepresented individuals in research.

BACKGROUND: Associations between low health literacy (HL) and adverse health
outcomes have been well documented in the outpatient setting; however, few
studies have examined associations between low HL and in-hospital outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To compare hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients with low HL
and those with adequate HL.
DESIGN: Hospital-based cohort study.
SETTING: Academic urban tertiary-care hospital.
PATIENTS: Hospitalized general medicine patients.
MEASUREMENTS: We measured HL using the Brief Health Literacy Screen. Severity of 
illness and LOS were obtained from administrative data. Multivariable linear
regression controlling for illness severity and sociodemographic variables was
employed to measure the association between HL and LOS.
RESULTS: Among 5540 participants, 20% (1104/5540) had low HL. Participants with
low HL had a longer average LOS (6.0 vs 5.4 days, P < 0.001). Low HL was
associated with an 11.1% longer LOS (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1%-16.1%; P 
< 0.001) in multivariate analysis. This effect was significantly modified by
gender (P = 0.02). Low HL was associated with a 17.8% longer LOS among men (95%
CI, 10.0%-25.7%; P < 0.001), but only a 7.7% longer LOS among women (95% CI,
1.9%-13.5%; P = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center cohort study, low HL was associated with a
longer hospital LOS. The findings suggest that the adverse effects of low HL may 
extend into the inpatient setting, indicating that targeted interventions may be 
needed for patients with low HL. Further work is needed to explore these negative
consequences and potential mitigating factors.

OBJECTIVE: To assess multiple Hb-based measures of anemia in hospitalized
patients and test whether these are associated with fatigue.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: Urban, academic medical center.
PATIENTS: Hospitalized general medicine patients, age =50 years, with any Hb < 9 
g/dL.
MEASUREMENTS: Measures of anemia were created for each patient based on the Hb
values from their hospitalization (mean, median, minimum, maximum, admission, and
discharge). Fatigue was measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue subscale.
RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-four patients participated. Minimum Hb was strongly
associated with fatigue. Patients with a minimum Hb of < 8 g/dL had higher
fatigue levels (mean FACIT [standard deviation] Hb < 7 g/dL: 25 [13], 7 g/ dL =
Hb <8 g/dL: 25 [14] Hb =8 g/dL: 29 [14], P = 0.001) and were more likely to
report high levels of fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue < 27) (56% vs 41%; P = 0.002). Mean 
Hb had a less robust association with fatigue than minimum Hb, and no other
measure of Hb was associated with patients' fatigue levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimum Hb is associated with fatigue while hospitalized and may
help identify patients for interventions to address anemia-related fatigue.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether inpatient sleep duration and efficiency are
associated with a greater risk of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients with and
without diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of a prospective
cohort study, medical inpatients ≥50 years of age were interviewed, and their
charts were reviewed to obtain demographic data and diagnosis. Using World Health
Organization criteria, patients were categorized as having normal blood glucose, 
impaired fasting blood glucose, or hyperglycemia based on morning glucose from
the electronic health record. Wrist actigraphy measured sleep. Multivariable
ordinal logistic regression models, controlling for subject random effects,
tested the association between inpatient sleep duration and proportional odds of 
hyperglycemia versus impaired fasting blood glucose or impaired fasting blood
glucose versus normal blood glucose in hospitalized adults.
RESULTS: A total of 212 patients (60% female and 74% African American) were
enrolled. Roughly one-third (73, 34%) had diabetes. Objective inpatient sleep
measures did not differ between patients with or without diabetes. In ordinal
logistic regression models, each additional hour of in-hospital sleep was
associated with an 11% (odds ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.80, 0.99]; P = 0.043) lower
proportional odds of a higher glucose category the next morning (hyperglycemia
vs. elevated and elevated vs. normal). Every 10% increase in sleep efficiency was
associated with an 18% lower proportional odds of a higher glucose category (odds
ratio 0.82 [95% CI 0.74, 0.89]; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among medical inpatients, both shorter sleep duration and worse
sleep efficiency were independently associated with greater proportional odds of 
hyperglycemia and impaired fasting glucose.

BACKGROUND: Wearable face-mounted computers such as Google Glass™ , Microsoft
HoloLens™, and Oculus' Rift®, are increasingly being tested in hospital care.
These devices challenge social etiquette, raise privacy issues, and may disrupt
the intimacy of the doctor patient relationship. We aimed to determine patients' 
perception of and their privacy concerns with an archetype of wearable
face-mounted computer devices, Google Glass.
METHODS: Hospitalized inpatients were asked about their familiarity with Glass,
how comfortable they would be and if they would be concerned about privacy if
their physician wore Glass, if the use of Glass would affect their trust in their
physician, and if they would want their physician to wear Glass if it improved
their care.
RESULTS: Most (73%) respondents were unfamiliar with Glass, though 64% would be
comfortable if their doctor wore Glass. Under half (46%) of respondents were
concerned about privacy with the use of Glass. Seventy-six percent (76%) of
respondents stated their doctor wearing Glass would not affect their trust in
their doctor. Patients concerned about their privacy were less likely to trust
their doctor if their doctor wore Glass (17% vs. 0%, p<0.01). Sixty-five percent 
(65%) of respondents would want their doctor to wear Glass if it improved their
care.
CONCLUSION: Most patients appear open to and would want their doctor to use
face-mounted wearable computers such as Glass, even when unfamiliar with this
technology. While some patients expressed concerns about privacy, patients were
much less concerned about wearable technologies affecting the trust they have in 
their physician.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes guidelines recommend individualizing glycemic goals (A1C)
for older patients. The aim of this study was to assess a personalized Web-based 
decision support tool.
METHODS: We randomized physicians and their patients with type 2 diabetes (≥65
years of age) to a support tool or educational pamphlet (75:25 patients). Prior
to a visit, intervention patients interacted with the tool, which provided
personalized risk predictions and elicited treatment preferences. Main outcomes
included 1) patient-doctor communication, 2) decisional conflict, 3) changes in
goals, and 4) intervention acceptability.
RESULTS: We did not find significant differences in proportions of patients who
had an A1C discussion (91% intervention v. 76% control; P = 0.19). Intervention
patients had larger declines in the informed subscale of decisional conflict (-20
v. 0, respectively; P = 0.04). There were no significant differences in
proportions of patients with changes in goals (49% v. 28%, respectively; P =
0.08). Most intervention patients reported that the tool was easy to use (91%)
and helped them to communicate (84%). A limitation was that this was a pilot
trial at one academic institution.
CONCLUSIONS: Web-based decision support tools may be a practical approach to
facilitating the personalization of goals for chronic conditions.

OBJECTIVE: To assess multiple Hb-based measures of anemia in hospitalized
patients and test whether these are associated with fatigue.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: Urban, academic medical center.
PATIENTS: Hospitalized general medicine patients, age =50 years, with any Hb < 9 
g/dL.
MEASUREMENTS: Measures of anemia were created for each patient based on the Hb
values from their hospitalization (mean, median, minimum, maximum, admission, and
discharge). Fatigue was measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue subscale.
RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-four patients participated. Minimum Hb was strongly
associated with fatigue. Patients with a minimum Hb of < 8 g/dL had higher
fatigue levels (mean FACIT [standard deviation] Hb < 7 g/dL: 25 [13], 7 g/ dL =
Hb <8 g/dL: 25 [14] Hb =8 g/dL: 29 [14], P = 0.001) and were more likely to
report high levels of fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue < 27) (56% vs 41%; P = 0.002). Mean 
Hb had a less robust association with fatigue than minimum Hb, and no other
measure of Hb was associated with patients' fatigue levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimum Hb is associated with fatigue while hospitalized and may
help identify patients for interventions to address anemia-related fatigue.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether inpatient sleep duration and efficiency are
associated with a greater risk of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients with and
without diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of a prospective
cohort study, medical inpatients ≥50 years of age were interviewed, and their
charts were reviewed to obtain demographic data and diagnosis. Using World Health
Organization criteria, patients were categorized as having normal blood glucose, 
impaired fasting blood glucose, or hyperglycemia based on morning glucose from
the electronic health record. Wrist actigraphy measured sleep. Multivariable
ordinal logistic regression models, controlling for subject random effects,
tested the association between inpatient sleep duration and proportional odds of 
hyperglycemia versus impaired fasting blood glucose or impaired fasting blood
glucose versus normal blood glucose in hospitalized adults.
RESULTS: A total of 212 patients (60% female and 74% African American) were
enrolled. Roughly one-third (73, 34%) had diabetes. Objective inpatient sleep
measures did not differ between patients with or without diabetes. In ordinal
logistic regression models, each additional hour of in-hospital sleep was
associated with an 11% (odds ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.80, 0.99]; P = 0.043) lower
proportional odds of a higher glucose category the next morning (hyperglycemia
vs. elevated and elevated vs. normal). Every 10% increase in sleep efficiency was
associated with an 18% lower proportional odds of a higher glucose category (odds
ratio 0.82 [95% CI 0.74, 0.89]; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among medical inpatients, both shorter sleep duration and worse
sleep efficiency were independently associated with greater proportional odds of 
hyperglycemia and impaired fasting glucose.

BACKGROUND: Wearable face-mounted computers such as Google Glass™ , Microsoft
HoloLens™, and Oculus' Rift®, are increasingly being tested in hospital care.
These devices challenge social etiquette, raise privacy issues, and may disrupt
the intimacy of the doctor patient relationship. We aimed to determine patients' 
perception of and their privacy concerns with an archetype of wearable
face-mounted computer devices, Google Glass.
METHODS: Hospitalized inpatients were asked about their familiarity with Glass,
how comfortable they would be and if they would be concerned about privacy if
their physician wore Glass, if the use of Glass would affect their trust in their
physician, and if they would want their physician to wear Glass if it improved
their care.
RESULTS: Most (73%) respondents were unfamiliar with Glass, though 64% would be
comfortable if their doctor wore Glass. Under half (46%) of respondents were
concerned about privacy with the use of Glass. Seventy-six percent (76%) of
respondents stated their doctor wearing Glass would not affect their trust in
their doctor. Patients concerned about their privacy were less likely to trust
their doctor if their doctor wore Glass (17% vs. 0%, p<0.01). Sixty-five percent 
(65%) of respondents would want their doctor to wear Glass if it improved their
care.
CONCLUSION: Most patients appear open to and would want their doctor to use
face-mounted wearable computers such as Glass, even when unfamiliar with this
technology. While some patients expressed concerns about privacy, patients were
much less concerned about wearable technologies affecting the trust they have in 
their physician.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes guidelines recommend individualizing glycemic goals (A1C)
for older patients. The aim of this study was to assess a personalized Web-based 
decision support tool.
METHODS: We randomized physicians and their patients with type 2 diabetes (≥65
years of age) to a support tool or educational pamphlet (75:25 patients). Prior
to a visit, intervention patients interacted with the tool, which provided
personalized risk predictions and elicited treatment preferences. Main outcomes
included 1) patient-doctor communication, 2) decisional conflict, 3) changes in
goals, and 4) intervention acceptability.
RESULTS: We did not find significant differences in proportions of patients who
had an A1C discussion (91% intervention v. 76% control; P = 0.19). Intervention
patients had larger declines in the informed subscale of decisional conflict (-20
v. 0, respectively; P = 0.04). There were no significant differences in
proportions of patients with changes in goals (49% v. 28%, respectively; P =
0.08). Most intervention patients reported that the tool was easy to use (91%)
and helped them to communicate (84%). A limitation was that this was a pilot
trial at one academic institution.
CONCLUSIONS: Web-based decision support tools may be a practical approach to
facilitating the personalization of goals for chronic conditions.

OBJECTIVE: This article presents and describes our methods in developing a novel 
strategy for recruitment of underrepresented, community-based participants, for
pragmatic research studies leveraging routinely collected electronic health
record (EHR) data.
METHODS: We designed a new approach for recruiting eligible patients from the
community, while also leveraging affiliated health systems to extract clinical
data for community participants. The strategy involves methods for data
collection, linkage, and tracking. In this workflow, potential participants are
identified in the community and surveyed regarding eligibility. These data are
then encrypted and deidentified via a hashing algorithm for linkage of the
community participant back to a record at a clinical site. The linkage allows for
eligibility verification and automated follow-up. Longitudinal data are collected
by querying the EHR data and surveying the community participant directly. We
discuss this strategy within the context of two national research projects, a
clinical trial and an observational cohort study.
CONCLUSION: The community-based recruitment strategy is a novel, low-touch,
clinical trial enrollment method to engage a diverse set of participants. Direct 
outreach to community participants, while utilizing EHR data for clinical
information and follow-up, allows for efficient recruitment and follow-up
strategies. This new strategy for recruitment links data reported from community 
participants to clinical data in the EHR and allows for eligibility verification 
and automated follow-up. The workflow has the potential to improve recruitment
efficiency and engage traditionally underrepresented individuals in research.

BACKGROUND: Associations between low health literacy (HL) and adverse health
outcomes have been well documented in the outpatient setting; however, few
studies have examined associations between low HL and in-hospital outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To compare hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients with low HL
and those with adequate HL.
DESIGN: Hospital-based cohort study.
SETTING: Academic urban tertiary-care hospital.
PATIENTS: Hospitalized general medicine patients.
MEASUREMENTS: We measured HL using the Brief Health Literacy Screen. Severity of 
illness and LOS were obtained from administrative data. Multivariable linear
regression controlling for illness severity and sociodemographic variables was
employed to measure the association between HL and LOS.
RESULTS: Among 5540 participants, 20% (1104/5540) had low HL. Participants with
low HL had a longer average LOS (6.0 vs 5.4 days, P < 0.001). Low HL was
associated with an 11.1% longer LOS (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1%-16.1%; P 
< 0.001) in multivariate analysis. This effect was significantly modified by
gender (P = 0.02). Low HL was associated with a 17.8% longer LOS among men (95%
CI, 10.0%-25.7%; P < 0.001), but only a 7.7% longer LOS among women (95% CI,
1.9%-13.5%; P = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center cohort study, low HL was associated with a
longer hospital LOS. The findings suggest that the adverse effects of low HL may 
extend into the inpatient setting, indicating that targeted interventions may be 
needed for patients with low HL. Further work is needed to explore these negative
consequences and potential mitigating factors.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes guidelines recommend individualizing glycemic goals (A1C)
for older patients. The aim of this study was to assess a personalized Web-based 
decision support tool.
METHODS: We randomized physicians and their patients with type 2 diabetes (≥65
years of age) to a support tool or educational pamphlet (75:25 patients). Prior
to a visit, intervention patients interacted with the tool, which provided
personalized risk predictions and elicited treatment preferences. Main outcomes
included 1) patient-doctor communication, 2) decisional conflict, 3) changes in
goals, and 4) intervention acceptability.
RESULTS: We did not find significant differences in proportions of patients who
had an A1C discussion (91% intervention v. 76% control; P = 0.19). Intervention
patients had larger declines in the informed subscale of decisional conflict (-20
v. 0, respectively; P = 0.04). There were no significant differences in
proportions of patients with changes in goals (49% v. 28%, respectively; P =
0.08). Most intervention patients reported that the tool was easy to use (91%)
and helped them to communicate (84%). A limitation was that this was a pilot
trial at one academic institution.
CONCLUSIONS: Web-based decision support tools may be a practical approach to
facilitating the personalization of goals for chronic conditions.

OBJECTIVE: This article presents and describes our methods in developing a novel 
strategy for recruitment of underrepresented, community-based participants, for
pragmatic research studies leveraging routinely collected electronic health
record (EHR) data.
METHODS: We designed a new approach for recruiting eligible patients from the
community, while also leveraging affiliated health systems to extract clinical
data for community participants. The strategy involves methods for data
collection, linkage, and tracking. In this workflow, potential participants are
identified in the community and surveyed regarding eligibility. These data are
then encrypted and deidentified via a hashing algorithm for linkage of the
community participant back to a record at a clinical site. The linkage allows for
eligibility verification and automated follow-up. Longitudinal data are collected
by querying the EHR data and surveying the community participant directly. We
discuss this strategy within the context of two national research projects, a
clinical trial and an observational cohort study.
CONCLUSION: The community-based recruitment strategy is a novel, low-touch,
clinical trial enrollment method to engage a diverse set of participants. Direct 
outreach to community participants, while utilizing EHR data for clinical
information and follow-up, allows for efficient recruitment and follow-up
strategies. This new strategy for recruitment links data reported from community 
participants to clinical data in the EHR and allows for eligibility verification 
and automated follow-up. The workflow has the potential to improve recruitment
efficiency and engage traditionally underrepresented individuals in research.

BACKGROUND: Associations between low health literacy (HL) and adverse health
outcomes have been well documented in the outpatient setting; however, few
studies have examined associations between low HL and in-hospital outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To compare hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients with low HL
and those with adequate HL.
DESIGN: Hospital-based cohort study.
SETTING: Academic urban tertiary-care hospital.
PATIENTS: Hospitalized general medicine patients.
MEASUREMENTS: We measured HL using the Brief Health Literacy Screen. Severity of 
illness and LOS were obtained from administrative data. Multivariable linear
regression controlling for illness severity and sociodemographic variables was
employed to measure the association between HL and LOS.
RESULTS: Among 5540 participants, 20% (1104/5540) had low HL. Participants with
low HL had a longer average LOS (6.0 vs 5.4 days, P < 0.001). Low HL was
associated with an 11.1% longer LOS (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1%-16.1%; P 
< 0.001) in multivariate analysis. This effect was significantly modified by
gender (P = 0.02). Low HL was associated with a 17.8% longer LOS among men (95%
CI, 10.0%-25.7%; P < 0.001), but only a 7.7% longer LOS among women (95% CI,
1.9%-13.5%; P = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center cohort study, low HL was associated with a
longer hospital LOS. The findings suggest that the adverse effects of low HL may 
extend into the inpatient setting, indicating that targeted interventions may be 
needed for patients with low HL. Further work is needed to explore these negative
consequences and potential mitigating factors.

OBJECTIVE: To assess multiple Hb-based measures of anemia in hospitalized
patients and test whether these are associated with fatigue.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: Urban, academic medical center.
PATIENTS: Hospitalized general medicine patients, age =50 years, with any Hb < 9 
g/dL.
MEASUREMENTS: Measures of anemia were created for each patient based on the Hb
values from their hospitalization (mean, median, minimum, maximum, admission, and
discharge). Fatigue was measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue subscale.
RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-four patients participated. Minimum Hb was strongly
associated with fatigue. Patients with a minimum Hb of < 8 g/dL had higher
fatigue levels (mean FACIT [standard deviation] Hb < 7 g/dL: 25 [13], 7 g/ dL =
Hb <8 g/dL: 25 [14] Hb =8 g/dL: 29 [14], P = 0.001) and were more likely to
report high levels of fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue < 27) (56% vs 41%; P = 0.002). Mean 
Hb had a less robust association with fatigue than minimum Hb, and no other
measure of Hb was associated with patients' fatigue levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimum Hb is associated with fatigue while hospitalized and may
help identify patients for interventions to address anemia-related fatigue.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether inpatient sleep duration and efficiency are
associated with a greater risk of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients with and
without diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of a prospective
cohort study, medical inpatients ≥50 years of age were interviewed, and their
charts were reviewed to obtain demographic data and diagnosis. Using World Health
Organization criteria, patients were categorized as having normal blood glucose, 
impaired fasting blood glucose, or hyperglycemia based on morning glucose from
the electronic health record. Wrist actigraphy measured sleep. Multivariable
ordinal logistic regression models, controlling for subject random effects,
tested the association between inpatient sleep duration and proportional odds of 
hyperglycemia versus impaired fasting blood glucose or impaired fasting blood
glucose versus normal blood glucose in hospitalized adults.
RESULTS: A total of 212 patients (60% female and 74% African American) were
enrolled. Roughly one-third (73, 34%) had diabetes. Objective inpatient sleep
measures did not differ between patients with or without diabetes. In ordinal
logistic regression models, each additional hour of in-hospital sleep was
associated with an 11% (odds ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.80, 0.99]; P = 0.043) lower
proportional odds of a higher glucose category the next morning (hyperglycemia
vs. elevated and elevated vs. normal). Every 10% increase in sleep efficiency was
associated with an 18% lower proportional odds of a higher glucose category (odds
ratio 0.82 [95% CI 0.74, 0.89]; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among medical inpatients, both shorter sleep duration and worse
sleep efficiency were independently associated with greater proportional odds of 
hyperglycemia and impaired fasting glucose.

BACKGROUND: Wearable face-mounted computers such as Google Glass™ , Microsoft
HoloLens™, and Oculus' Rift®, are increasingly being tested in hospital care.
These devices challenge social etiquette, raise privacy issues, and may disrupt
the intimacy of the doctor patient relationship. We aimed to determine patients' 
perception of and their privacy concerns with an archetype of wearable
face-mounted computer devices, Google Glass.
METHODS: Hospitalized inpatients were asked about their familiarity with Glass,
how comfortable they would be and if they would be concerned about privacy if
their physician wore Glass, if the use of Glass would affect their trust in their
physician, and if they would want their physician to wear Glass if it improved
their care.
RESULTS: Most (73%) respondents were unfamiliar with Glass, though 64% would be
comfortable if their doctor wore Glass. Under half (46%) of respondents were
concerned about privacy with the use of Glass. Seventy-six percent (76%) of
respondents stated their doctor wearing Glass would not affect their trust in
their doctor. Patients concerned about their privacy were less likely to trust
their doctor if their doctor wore Glass (17% vs. 0%, p<0.01). Sixty-five percent 
(65%) of respondents would want their doctor to wear Glass if it improved their
care.
CONCLUSION: Most patients appear open to and would want their doctor to use
face-mounted wearable computers such as Glass, even when unfamiliar with this
technology. While some patients expressed concerns about privacy, patients were
much less concerned about wearable technologies affecting the trust they have in 
their physician.

CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center cohort study, low HL was associated with a
longer hospital LOS. The findings suggest that the adverse effects of low HL may 
extend into the inpatient setting, indicating that targeted interventions may be 
needed for patients with low HL. Further work is needed to explore these negative
consequences and potential mitigating factors.

OBJECTIVE: To assess multiple Hb-based measures of anemia in hospitalized
patients and test whether these are associated with fatigue.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: Urban, academic medical center.
PATIENTS: Hospitalized general medicine patients, age =50 years, with any Hb < 9 
g/dL.
MEASUREMENTS: Measures of anemia were created for each patient based on the Hb
values from their hospitalization (mean, median, minimum, maximum, admission, and
discharge). Fatigue was measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue subscale.
RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-four patients participated. Minimum Hb was strongly
associated with fatigue. Patients with a minimum Hb of < 8 g/dL had higher
fatigue levels (mean FACIT [standard deviation] Hb < 7 g/dL: 25 [13], 7 g/ dL =
Hb <8 g/dL: 25 [14] Hb =8 g/dL: 29 [14], P = 0.001) and were more likely to
report high levels of fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue < 27) (56% vs 41%; P = 0.002). Mean 
Hb had a less robust association with fatigue than minimum Hb, and no other
measure of Hb was associated with patients' fatigue levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimum Hb is associated with fatigue while hospitalized and may
help identify patients for interventions to address anemia-related fatigue.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether inpatient sleep duration and efficiency are
associated with a greater risk of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients with and
without diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of a prospective
cohort study, medical inpatients ≥50 years of age were interviewed, and their
charts were reviewed to obtain demographic data and diagnosis. Using World Health
Organization criteria, patients were categorized as having normal blood glucose, 
impaired fasting blood glucose, or hyperglycemia based on morning glucose from
the electronic health record. Wrist actigraphy measured sleep. Multivariable
ordinal logistic regression models, controlling for subject random effects,
tested the association between inpatient sleep duration and proportional odds of 
hyperglycemia versus impaired fasting blood glucose or impaired fasting blood
glucose versus normal blood glucose in hospitalized adults.
RESULTS: A total of 212 patients (60% female and 74% African American) were
enrolled. Roughly one-third (73, 34%) had diabetes. Objective inpatient sleep
measures did not differ between patients with or without diabetes. In ordinal
logistic regression models, each additional hour of in-hospital sleep was
associated with an 11% (odds ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.80, 0.99]; P = 0.043) lower
proportional odds of a higher glucose category the next morning (hyperglycemia
vs. elevated and elevated vs. normal). Every 10% increase in sleep efficiency was
associated with an 18% lower proportional odds of a higher glucose category (odds
ratio 0.82 [95% CI 0.74, 0.89]; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among medical inpatients, both shorter sleep duration and worse
sleep efficiency were independently associated with greater proportional odds of 
hyperglycemia and impaired fasting glucose.

BACKGROUND: Wearable face-mounted computers such as Google Glass™ , Microsoft
HoloLens™, and Oculus' Rift®, are increasingly being tested in hospital care.
These devices challenge social etiquette, raise privacy issues, and may disrupt
the intimacy of the doctor patient relationship. We aimed to determine patients' 
perception of and their privacy concerns with an archetype of wearable
face-mounted computer devices, Google Glass.
METHODS: Hospitalized inpatients were asked about their familiarity with Glass,
how comfortable they would be and if they would be concerned about privacy if
their physician wore Glass, if the use of Glass would affect their trust in their
physician, and if they would want their physician to wear Glass if it improved
their care.
RESULTS: Most (73%) respondents were unfamiliar with Glass, though 64% would be
comfortable if their doctor wore Glass. Under half (46%) of respondents were
concerned about privacy with the use of Glass. Seventy-six percent (76%) of
respondents stated their doctor wearing Glass would not affect their trust in
their doctor. Patients concerned about their privacy were less likely to trust
their doctor if their doctor wore Glass (17% vs. 0%, p<0.01). Sixty-five percent 
(65%) of respondents would want their doctor to wear Glass if it improved their
care.
CONCLUSION: Most patients appear open to and would want their doctor to use
face-mounted wearable computers such as Glass, even when unfamiliar with this
technology. While some patients expressed concerns about privacy, patients were
much less concerned about wearable technologies affecting the trust they have in 
their physician.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes guidelines recommend individualizing glycemic goals (A1C)
for older patients. The aim of this study was to assess a personalized Web-based 
decision support tool.
METHODS: We randomized physicians and their patients with type 2 diabetes (≥65
years of age) to a support tool or educational pamphlet (75:25 patients). Prior
to a visit, intervention patients interacted with the tool, which provided
personalized risk predictions and elicited treatment preferences. Main outcomes
included 1) patient-doctor communication, 2) decisional conflict, 3) changes in
goals, and 4) intervention acceptability.
RESULTS: We did not find significant differences in proportions of patients who
had an A1C discussion (91% intervention v. 76% control; P = 0.19). Intervention
patients had larger declines in the informed subscale of decisional conflict (-20
v. 0, respectively; P = 0.04). There were no significant differences in
proportions of patients with changes in goals (49% v. 28%, respectively; P =
0.08). Most intervention patients reported that the tool was easy to use (91%)
and helped them to communicate (84%). A limitation was that this was a pilot
trial at one academic institution.
CONCLUSIONS: Web-based decision support tools may be a practical approach to
facilitating the personalization of goals for chronic conditions.

BACKGROUND: Associations between low health literacy (HL) and adverse health
outcomes have been well documented in the outpatient setting; however, few
studies have examined associations between low HL and in-hospital outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To compare hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients with low HL
and those with adequate HL.
DESIGN: Hospital-based cohort study.
SETTING: Academic urban tertiary-care hospital.
PATIENTS: Hospitalized general medicine patients.
MEASUREMENTS: We measured HL using the Brief Health Literacy Screen. Severity of 
illness and LOS were obtained from administrative data. Multivariable linear
regression controlling for illness severity and sociodemographic variables was
employed to measure the association between HL and LOS.
RESULTS: Among 5540 participants, 20% (1104/5540) had low HL. Participants with
low HL had a longer average LOS (6.0 vs 5.4 days, P < 0.001). Low HL was
associated with an 11.1% longer LOS (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1%-16.1%; P 
< 0.001) in multivariate analysis. This effect was significantly modified by
gender (P = 0.02). Low HL was associated with a 17.8% longer LOS among men (95%
CI, 10.0%-25.7%; P < 0.001), but only a 7.7% longer LOS among women (95% CI,
1.9%-13.5%; P = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center cohort study, low HL was associated with a
longer hospital LOS. The findings suggest that the adverse effects of low HL may 
extend into the inpatient setting, indicating that targeted interventions may be 
needed for patients with low HL. Further work is needed to explore these negative
consequences and potential mitigating factors.

regression controlling for illness severity and sociodemographic variables was
employed to measure the association between HL and LOS.
RESULTS: Among 5540 participants, 20% (1104/5540) had low HL. Participants with
low HL had a longer average LOS (6.0 vs 5.4 days, P < 0.001). Low HL was
associated with an 11.1% longer LOS (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1%-16.1%; P 
< 0.001) in multivariate analysis. This effect was significantly modified by
gender (P = 0.02). Low HL was associated with a 17.8% longer LOS among men (95%
CI, 10.0%-25.7%; P < 0.001), but only a 7.7% longer LOS among women (95% CI,
1.9%-13.5%; P = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center cohort study, low HL was associated with a
longer hospital LOS. The findings suggest that the adverse effects of low HL may 
extend into the inpatient setting, indicating that targeted interventions may be 
needed for patients with low HL. Further work is needed to explore these negative
consequences and potential mitigating factors.

BACKGROUND: Wearable face-mounted computers such as Google Glass™ , Microsoft
HoloLens™, and Oculus' Rift®, are increasingly being tested in hospital care.
These devices challenge social etiquette, raise privacy issues, and may disrupt
the intimacy of the doctor patient relationship. We aimed to determine patients' 
perception of and their privacy concerns with an archetype of wearable
face-mounted computer devices, Google Glass.
METHODS: Hospitalized inpatients were asked about their familiarity with Glass,
how comfortable they would be and if they would be concerned about privacy if
their physician wore Glass, if the use of Glass would affect their trust in their
physician, and if they would want their physician to wear Glass if it improved
their care.
RESULTS: Most (73%) respondents were unfamiliar with Glass, though 64% would be
comfortable if their doctor wore Glass. Under half (46%) of respondents were
concerned about privacy with the use of Glass. Seventy-six percent (76%) of
respondents stated their doctor wearing Glass would not affect their trust in
their doctor. Patients concerned about their privacy were less likely to trust
their doctor if their doctor wore Glass (17% vs. 0%, p<0.01). Sixty-five percent 
(65%) of respondents would want their doctor to wear Glass if it improved their
care.
CONCLUSION: Most patients appear open to and would want their doctor to use
face-mounted wearable computers such as Glass, even when unfamiliar with this
technology. While some patients expressed concerns about privacy, patients were
much less concerned about wearable technologies affecting the trust they have in 
their physician.

BACKGROUND: Associations between low health literacy (HL) and adverse health
outcomes have been well documented in the outpatient setting; however, few
studies have examined associations between low HL and in-hospital outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To compare hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients with low HL
and those with adequate HL.
DESIGN: Hospital-based cohort study.
SETTING: Academic urban tertiary-care hospital.
PATIENTS: Hospitalized general medicine patients.
MEASUREMENTS: We measured HL using the Brief Health Literacy Screen. Severity of 
illness and LOS were obtained from administrative data. Multivariable linear
regression controlling for illness severity and sociodemographic variables was
employed to measure the association between HL and LOS.

The Pathogenesis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): The Hypothesis of PCOS as
Functional Ovarian Hyperandrogenism Revisited.

Rosenfield RL(1), Ehrmann DA(1).

Author information:

University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60637.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was hypothesized to result from functional
ovarian hyperandrogenism (FOH) due to dysregulation of androgen secretion in
1989-1995. Subsequent studies have supported and amplified this hypothesis. When 
defined as otherwise unexplained hyperandrogenic oligoanovulation, two-thirds of 
PCOS cases have functionally typical FOH, characterized by 17-hydroxyprogesterone
hyperresponsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation. Two-thirds of the remaining PCOS
have FOH detectable by testosterone elevation after suppression of adrenal
androgen production. About 3% of PCOS have a related isolated functional adrenal 
hyperandrogenism. The remaining PCOS cases are mild and lack evidence of steroid 
secretory abnormalities; most of these are obese, which we postulate to account
for their atypical PCOS. Approximately half of normal women with polycystic
ovarian morphology (PCOM) have subclinical FOH-related steroidogenic defects.
Theca cells from polycystic ovaries of classic PCOS patients in long-term culture
have an intrinsic steroidogenic dysregulation that can account for the
steroidogenic abnormalities typical of FOH. These cells overexpress most
steroidogenic enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450c17. Overexpression of a
protein identified by genome-wide association screening, differentially expressed
in normal and neoplastic development 1A.V2, in normal theca cells has reproduced 
this PCOS phenotype in vitro. A metabolic syndrome of obesity-related and/or
intrinsic insulin resistance occurs in about half of PCOS patients, and the
compensatory hyperinsulinism has tissue-selective effects, which include
aggravation of hyperandrogenism. PCOS seems to arise as a complex trait that
results from the interaction of diverse genetic and environmental factors.
Heritable factors include PCOM, hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance, and
insulin secretory defects. Environmental factors include prenatal androgen
exposure and poor fetal growth, whereas acquired obesity is a major postnatal
factor. The variety of pathways involved and lack of a common thread attests to
the multifactorial nature and heterogeneity of the syndrome. Further research
into the fundamental basis of the disorder will be necessary to optimally correct
androgen levels, ovulation, and metabolic homeostasis.

Repeated Blood Cultures in Pediatric Febrile Neutropenia: Would Following the
Guidelines Alter the Outcome?

BACKGROUND: The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines
recommend collecting blood cultures for the first 3 days of febrile neutropenia
(FN) in the clinically stable oncology patient with persistent fevers.
Nonetheless, many physicians send daily blood cultures beyond 3 days, and the
impact of that practice is uncertain.
PROCEDURE: We reviewed pediatric FN episodes from July 2009 to May 2014 at
University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital. For each positive culture, we
determined if it was a pathogen or a contaminant. We reviewed episode and patient
demographics to identify risk factors for subsequent positive blood cultures in
the setting of an initially negative culture.
RESULTS: We identified 381 episodes of FN in 162 patients. Of those, 87 had a
positive blood culture on day 1 (21.0% incidence of bacteremia). Of 294 episodes 
with a negative blood culture on day 1, six (2.04%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.42-3.67) had a positive culture after day 3. Of those, three were pathogens
(1.02%, 95%CI -0.14 to 2.18), and only one was found in a hemodynamically stable 
patient (0.34%, 95%CI -0.33 to 1.01) with new mucositis. In the other two
patients, Escherichia coli was isolated from blood cultures after day 10 in the
setting of significant hemodynamic changes. Risk factor analysis performed in
stable patients yielded nonsignificant results.
CONCLUSIONS: Of 294 FN episodes with an initial negative blood culture, only one 
episode of bacteremia occurred without hemodynamic changes past day 3, supporting
the IDSA guidelines to discontinue blood cultures in stable FN patients after day
3.

Community respiratory viruses (CRV) are important agents of morbidity and
mortality within the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT)
population. Few proven methods to prevent CRV infections exist. No studies have
specifically investigated their impact on older patients. We reviewed patients 50
years and older undergoing HCT between 2009-2013 to determine the incidence of
CRV infection using multiplex PCR and risk factors for infection including
geriatric assessment (GA). Thirty-two first episode CRV infections occurred in
118 patients for a 1-year cumulative incidence of 27.2% (CI: 19.4-35.6%).
Hospitalization and mortality were restricted to those who developed lower
respiratory tract infections (LRTI) (n = 22, 69%). CRV infection contributed to 8
deaths (36% of LRTIs) and 7 of these patients were taking steroids for GvHD at
the time of infection. Health impairments by GA did not translate into increased 
risk for CRV infection. Steroid use at time of LRTI was associated with high
mortality.

The pathological processes resulting from parasitic infection are known to have
important impacts on the mother child dyad during pregnancy. The roles of
parasite transmission and the maternal immune response have been described in
diseases such as malaria, toxoplasmosis, and trypanosomiasis. However, the impact
of parasites of the genus Leishmania, etiological agents of the neglected
tropical diseases tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL),
is comparatively less well known, though it is an increasingly recognized concern
for infected mothers and their fetuses. In this review, we first consider the
pathophysiology of placental infection and transplacental transmission of this
parasite, and then discuss the role and mechanisms of the maternal immune system 
in simultaneously mediating maternal-fetal infection and adverse pregnancy
outcomes.

Viral infections have been proposed to elicit pathological processes leading to
the initiation of T helper 1 (TH1) immunity against dietary gluten and celiac
disease (CeD). To test this hypothesis and gain insights into mechanisms
underlying virus-induced loss of tolerance to dietary antigens, we developed a
viral infection model that makes use of two reovirus strains that infect the
intestine but differ in their immunopathological outcomes. Reovirus is an
avirulent pathogen that elicits protective immunity, but we discovered that it
can nonetheless disrupt intestinal immune homeostasis at inductive and effector
sites of oral tolerance by suppressing peripheral regulatory T cell (pTreg)
conversion and promoting TH1 immunity to dietary antigen. Initiation of TH1
immunity to dietary antigen was dependent on interferon regulatory factor 1 and
dissociated from suppression of pTreg conversion, which was mediated by type-1
interferon. Last, our study in humans supports a role for infection with
reovirus, a seemingly innocuous virus, in triggering the development of CeD.

Regulatory B cells (Bregs) attenuate the severity of experimental autoimmune
myasthenia gravis (EAMG) in an interleukin-10 (IL-10)-dependent manner. The goal 
of this study was to investigate the role of human Bregs in MG focusing on
CD19(+)CD1d(hi) CD5(+) and CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) subsets. We found that MG
patients exhibited a decrease in the frequency of both Breg subsets and IL-10
producing B cells within each subset, which correlated with disease severity. In 
addition, there was impaired suppression of Th1 polarization in MG. These
findings, taken together with EAMG data, indicate that Bregs play an important
role in regulating the severity of MG.

The Xpert Flu/RSV XC was compared to the FilmArray respiratory panel for
detection of influenza (Flu) A, Flu B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
using 128 nasopharyngeal swabs. Positive agreements were 100% for Flu A and RSV
and 92.3% for Flu B. The Xpert may be useful in clinical situations when
extensive testing is not required and may serve an important role in laboratories
already performing broader respiratory panel testing.

We systematically reviewed the literature on anal, penile, cervical, and
oropharyngeal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in Greece to provide a
comprehensive overview of HPV prevalence and to explore the reporting of HPV in
Greek men and women. A total of five databases, including PubMed and Scopus, were
searched up until 1 January 2015 for studies looking at HPV prevalence,
incidence, or risk factors by anatomical site. We identified 50 eligible studies 
for inclusion. The majority of them were cervical studies (n=26) followed by head
and neck studies (n=13) with only two studies exclusively focusing on anal sites 
and two on penile sites. The remaining studies examined prevalence from multiple 
sites. Most studies looked at small, high-risk populations, and HPV prevalence
ranged from 2.5-43.4% for cervical studies; 0-91% for head and neck studies;
54.6-78.4% for anal studies; and 20.3-66.7% for penile studies. Age, smoking, and
number of sexual partners were the commonly assessed risk factors. There were
significant sex and anatomic site disparities in the reporting of HPV prevalence.
Given the relationship between HPV infection and the increasing incidence of anal
cancer in men, more research is needed to reveal the prevalence of HPV at these
sites in Greek men, especially given the reports of the declining health of the
Greek population.

The microorganisms that inhabit hospitals may influence patient recovery and
outcome, although the complexity and diversity of these bacterial communities can
confound our ability to focus on potential pathogens in isolation. To develop a
community-level understanding of how microorganisms colonize and move through the
hospital environment, we characterized the bacterial dynamics among hospital
surfaces, patients, and staff over the course of 1 year as a new hospital became 
operational. The bacteria in patient rooms, particularly on bedrails,
consistently resembled the skin microbiota of the patient occupying the room.
Bacterial communities on patients and room surfaces became increasingly similar
over the course of a patient's stay. Temporal correlations in community structure
demonstrated that patients initially acquired room-associated taxa that predated 
their stay but that their own microbial signatures began to influence the room
community structure over time. The α- and β-diversity of patient skin samples
were only weakly or nonsignificantly associated with clinical factors such as
chemotherapy, antibiotic usage, and surgical recovery, and no factor except for
ambulatory status affected microbial similarity between the microbiotas of a
patient and their room. Metagenomic analyses revealed that genes conferring
antimicrobial resistance were consistently more abundant on room surfaces than on
the skin of the patients inhabiting those rooms. In addition, persistent unique
genotypes of Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium were identified. Dynamic
Bayesian network analysis suggested that hospital staff were more likely to be a 
source of bacteria on the skin of patients than the reverse but that there were
no universal patterns of transmission across patient rooms.

Sponges harbor a remarkable diversity of microbial symbionts in which signal
molecules can accumulate and enable cell-cell communication, such as quorum
sensing (QS). Bacteria capable of QS were isolated from marine sponges; however, 
an extremely small fraction of the sponge microbiome is amenable to cultivation. 
We took advantage of community genome assembly and binning to investigate the
uncultured majority of sponge symbionts. We identified a complete
N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-QS system (designated TswIR) and seven partial
luxI homologues in the microbiome of Theonella swinhoei. The TswIR system was
novel and shown to be associated with an alphaproteobacterium of the order
Rhodobacterales, here termed Rhodobacterales bacterium TS309. The tswI gene, when
expressed in Escherichia coli, produced three AHLs, two of which were also
identified in a T. swinhoei sponge extract. The taxonomic affiliation of the 16S 
rRNA of Rhodobacterales bacterium TS309 to a sponge-coral specific clade, its
enrichment in sponge versus seawater and marine sediment samples, and the
presence of sponge-specific features, such as ankyrin-like domains and
tetratricopeptide repeats, indicate a likely symbiotic nature of this bacterium.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the training of medical students and their confidence in
urethral catheter placement, given growing evidence of unnecessary urology
consults and iatrogenic injury.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A third-year medical school class was queried about their
attitudes and knowledge of catheter placement before and after the Clinical
Biennium. The Clinical Biennium introduces hands-on skills prior to clinical
clerkships. Urethral catheterisation is one of the skill stations that students
rotate through, and urology residents provide a didactic session and supervised
simulation. Confidence was self-rated regarding catheter technique, knowledge,
troubleshooting, and comfort with placement in the same and opposite gender.
Factual questions were posed about proper insertion and malfunctioning catheters.
RESULTS: In all, 92 students participated in the initial survey, 41% female and
59% male, and 87% of the students had never placed a catheter. Students desired
high confidence in catheter skills (4.4/5). There were no significant differences
in responses for those with a desire to pursue urology vs other specialties, or
procedural fields compared with non-procedural fields. Prior independent learning
was reported by 38% of students and was a predictor for increased confidence
across all domains (P < 0.05). In all, 16.7% of students initially identified
proper male urethral insertion distance, which improved to 95.6% after the
session. Student interest in urology modestly increased after the educational
session (P = 0.028). At 3-6 months follow-up, students had performed a median
(interquartile range) of 4 (2-7) urethral catheter placements, and 74.2% of
students rated training useful or extremely useful. Indeed, 54.8% desired more
instruction. Knowledge assessment indicated that 93% of students retained
comprehension of proper male urethral insertion distance. Clinical Foley training
rarely contradicted instruction from the Clinical Biennium (6.5%). At all
time-points, medical student knowledge for troubleshooting catheters was low.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical students strive for high confidence in urethral catheter
placement. Prior targeted education improves confidence and knowledge. Together
with clinical experience, these effects are durable up to 6 months.

In this study, we evaluated trends and outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT) in adults ≥70 years with hematologic malignancies across
the United States. Adults ≥70 years with a hematologic malignancy undergoing
first allogeneic HCT in the United States between 2000 and 2013 and reported to
the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research were eligible. 
Transplant utilization and transplant outcomes, including overall survival (OS), 
progression-free survival (PFS), and transplant-related mortality (TRM) were
studied. One thousand one hundred and six patients ≥70 years underwent HCT across
103 transplant centers. The number and proportion of allografts performed in this
population rose markedly over the past decade, accounting for 0.1% of transplants
in 2000 to 3.85% (N = 298) in 2013. Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic
syndromes represented the most common disease indications. Two-year OS and PFS
significantly improved over time (OS: 26% [95% confidence interval (CI), 21% to
33%] in 2000-2007 to 39% [95% CI, 35% to 42%] in 2008-2013, P < .001; PFS: 22%
[16% to 28%] in 2000-2007 to 32% [95% CI, 29% to 36%] in 2008-2013, P = .003).
Two-year TRM ranged from 33% to 35% and was unchanged over time (P = .54).
Multivariable analysis of OS in the modern era of 2008-2013 revealed higher
comorbidity by HCT comorbidity index ≥3 (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; P = .006),
umbilical cord blood graft (HR, 1.97; P = .0002), and myeloablative conditioning 
(HR, 1.61; P = .0002) as adverse factors. Over the past decade, utilization and
survival after allogeneic transplant have increased in patients ≥70 years. Select
adults ≥70 years with hematologic malignancies should be considered for
transplant.

We sought to confirm the prognostic importance of simple clinically available
biomarkers of C-reactive protein, serum albumin, and ferritin prior to allogeneic
hematopoietic cell transplantation. The study population consisted of 784 adults 
with acute myeloid leukemia in remission or myelodysplastic syndromes undergoing 
unrelated donor transplant reported to the Center for International Blood and
Marrow Transplant Research. C-reactive protein and ferritin were centrally
quantified by ELISA from cryopreserved plasma whereas each center provided
pre-transplant albumin. In multivariate analysis, transplant-related mortality
was associated with the pre-specified thresholds of C-reactive protein more than 
10 mg/L (P=0.008) and albumin less than 3.5 g/dL (P=0.01) but not ferritin more
than 2500 ng/mL. Only low albumin independently influenced overall mortality.
Optimal thresholds affecting transplant-related mortality were defined as:
C-reactive protein more than 3.67 mg/L, log(ferritin), and albumin less than 3.4 
g/dL. A 3-level biomarker risk group based on these values separated risks of
transplant-related mortality: low risk (reference), intermediate (HR=1.66,
P=0.015), and high risk (HR=2.7, P<0.001). One-year survival was 74%, 67% and 56%
for low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups. Routinely available pre-transplant 
biomarkers independently risk-stratify for transplant-related mortality and
survival.

Analysis of the clinical characteristics of hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HSCT) donors has proven beneficial for identifying cases of heritable
hematopoietic disorders. This study examines poor peripheral blood hematopoietic 
stem cell mobilization after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration
among 328 donors as a potential marker for suspected familial predisposition to
myeloid malignancies. Here, we present data comparing the clinical
characteristics of poor-mobilizing versus nonpoor-mobilizing donors and the
results of panel-based sequencing of hematopoietic genes in poor-mobilizing
donors. From this analysis, we identified a novel case of a donor-derived
myelodysplastic syndrome in an HSCT recipient that is consistent with clonal
evolution of TET2-mutated clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) 
within the donor. This study demonstrates the potential risk of using
hematopoietic stem cells from a donor with CHIP and raises the question of
whether there should be increased screening measures to identify such donors.

Busulfan (Bu)-containing regimens are commonly used in myeloablative conditioning
regimens before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Yet, there
is considerable variability on how Bu is administered related to frequency (4
times a day [Q6] or daily [Q24]) and combinations with other chemotherapeutic
agents (cyclophosphamide [Cy] or fludarabine [Flu]). We performed a prospective
cohort study of recipients of Bu-based conditioning according to contemporary
practices to compare different approaches (BuCy Q6, n = 495; BuFlu Q24, n = 331; 
BuCy Q24, n = 96; BuFlu Q6, n = 91) in patients with myeloid malignancies between
2009 and 2011. BuFlu Q24 recipients were more likely to be older and tended to
have worse performance status and a higher comorbid burden. The cumulative
incidences of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (P = .40), idiopathic pneumonia
(P = .50), and seizures (P = .50) did not differ across groups. One-year
HCT-related mortality ranged from 12% to 16% (P = .80), 3-year relapse incidence 
ranged from 32% to 36% (P = .80), and 3-year overall survival ranged from 51% to 
58% (P = .20) across groups. This study demonstrates that HCT conditioning
regimens using i.v. Bu Q6 or Q24 alone or in combination with Cy or Flu have
similar outcomes in the myeloablative setting for treatment of myeloid
malignancies.

Umbilical cord blood stem cell transplants are commonly used in adults lacking
HLA-identical donors. Delays in hematopoietic recovery contribute to mortality
and morbidity. To hasten recovery, we used co-infusion of progenitor cells from a
partially matched related donor and from an umbilical cord blood graft
(haplo-cord transplant). Here we compared the outcomes of haplo-cord and
double-cord transplants. A total of 97 adults underwent reduced intensity
conditioning followed by haplo-cord transplant and 193 patients received reduced 
intensity conditioning followed by double umbilical cord blood transplantation.
Patients in the haplo-cord group were more often from minority groups and had
more advanced malignancy. Haplo-cord recipients received
fludarabine-melphalan-anti-thymocyte globulin. Double umbilical cord blood
recipients received fludarabine-cyclophosphamide and low-dose total body
irradiation. In a multivariate analysis, haplo-cord had faster neutrophil
(HR=1.42, P=0.007) and platelet (HR=2.54, P<0.0001) recovery, lower risk of grade
II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (HR=0.26, P<0.0001) and chronic
graft-versus-host disease (HR=0.06, P<0.0001). Haplo-cord was associated with
decreased risk of relapse (HR 0.48, P=0.001). Graft-versus-host disease-free,
relapse-free survival was superior with haplo-cord (HR 0.63, P=0.002) but not
overall survival (HR=0.97, P=0.85). Haplo-cord transplantation using
fludarabine-melphalan-thymoglobulin conditioning hastens hematopoietic recovery
with a lower risk of relapse relative to double umbilical cord blood
transplantation using the commonly used fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-low-dose
total body irradiation conditioning. Graft-versus-host disease-free and
relapse-free survival is significantly improved. Haplo-cord is a readily
available graft source that improves outcomes and access to transplant for those 
lacking HLA-matched donors. Trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov identifiers
00943800 and 01810588.

Community respiratory viruses (CRV) are important agents of morbidity and
mortality within the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT)
population. Few proven methods to prevent CRV infections exist. No studies have
specifically investigated their impact on older patients. We reviewed patients 50
years and older undergoing HCT between 2009-2013 to determine the incidence of
CRV infection using multiplex PCR and risk factors for infection including
geriatric assessment (GA). Thirty-two first episode CRV infections occurred in
118 patients for a 1-year cumulative incidence of 27.2% (CI: 19.4-35.6%).
Hospitalization and mortality were restricted to those who developed lower
respiratory tract infections (LRTI) (n = 22, 69%). CRV infection contributed to 8
deaths (36% of LRTIs) and 7 of these patients were taking steroids for GvHD at
the time of infection. Health impairments by GA did not translate into increased 
risk for CRV infection. Steroid use at time of LRTI was associated with high
mortality.

Nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists in diabetic kidney disease.

Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago,

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Current data highlight the pathological aspects of excess
aldosterone in promoting glomerular hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis, and
proteinuria in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The role of nonsteroidal
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in DKD is being evaluated in
ongoing clinical trials.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies demonstrate beneficial effects of adding MRAs to 
the treatment regimen of patients with type 2 diabetes with nephropathy. The MRAs
spironolactone and eplerenone can protect against organ damage caused by elevated
levels of serum aldosterone in patients with heart failure and DKD but are
limited by their side effects, for example, hyperkalemia. Finerenone is more
selective for the mineralocorticoid receptor than spironolactone and has greater 
affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor than eplerenone. It reduces the
concentration of aldosterone without causing significant elevation in serum
potassium.
SUMMARY: MRAs have a clear role in reducing albuminuria when used with other
renin-angiotensin system blockers in DKD; however, hyperkalemia limits their use.
This article provides an overview of clinical studies with a novel MRA,
finerenone, and several nonsteroidal MRAs being studied for treatment in DKD.

Aims: Catheter-based renal artery denervation (RDN) has been shown to lower blood
pressure (BP) in certain patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Isolated
systolic hypertension (ISH) (systolic BP [SBP] ≥140 mmHg and diastolic BP <90
mmHg), characterized by increased vascular stiffness, is the predominant
hypertensive phenotype in elderly patients. This study compared baseline
characteristics and SBP change at 6 months between patients with ISH and combined
systolic–diastolic hypertension (CH).
Methods and Results: This study pooled data from 1103 patients from SYMPLICITY
HTN-3 and the Global SYMPLICITY Registry. A total of 429 patients had ISH, and
674 had CH. Patients with ISH were significantly older than those with CH (66 vs.
55 years), had more type 2 diabetes mellitus (52.9 vs. 34.6%), and a lower
estimated glomerular filtration rate (71.8 vs. 78.6 mL/min/1.73 m2); all P <
0.001. At 6 months, the SBP drop for CH patients was −18.7 ± 23.7 mmHg compared
with a reduction of −10.9 ± 21.7 mmHg for ISH patients −7.8 mmHg, 95% confidence 
interval, CI, −10.5, −5.1, P < 0.001). The change in 24-h SBP at 6 months was
−8.8 ± 16.2 mmHg in patients with CH vs. −5.8 ± 15.4 mmHg in ISH (−3.0 mmHg, 95% 
CI −5.4, −0.6, P = 0.015). Presence of ISH at baseline but not age was associated
with less pronounced BP changes following the procedure. The strongest predictor 
of office SBP reduction at 6 months was CH, followed by aldosterone antagonist
use and non-use of vasodilators.
Conclusion: The reduction in BP among patients with ISH following RDN was less
pronounced than the reduction in patients with CH.

AIMS: To investigate relationships between glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and
reported hypoglycaemia and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
METHODS: The EXAMINE trial randomized 5380 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
and a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event, in 49 countries, to
double-blind treatment with alogliptin or placebo in addition to standard of
care. We used Cox proportional hazards models to analyse relationships among
MACE, HbA1c levels and hypoglycaemic events.
RESULTS: Patients randomized to alogliptin achieved lower HbA1c levels than the
placebo group in all baseline HbA1c categories without differences in
hypoglycaemia rates. No systematic change was found in MACE rates according to
baseline HbA1c (Pinteraction  = 0.971) or HbA1c category at 1 month. Patients in 
the combined treatment groups (n = 5380) who experienced serious hypoglycaemia
(n = 34) had higher MACE rates than those who did not (35.3% vs 11.4%, adjusted
hazard ratio [HR] 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-4.60; P = .007),
although the association was less strong when analysing only events after the
hypoglycaemic event (adjusted HR 1.60, 95% CI 0.80, 3.20).
CONCLUSIONS: There were no relationships between baseline HbA1c levels or HbA1c
levels after 1 month of treatment and the risk of MACE. Alogliptin improved
glycaemic control without increasing hypoglycaemia. Reported events of
hypoglycaemia and serious hypoglycaemia were associated with MACE. These data
underscore the safety of alogliptin in improving glycaemic control in T2DM
post-ACS. Further study of hypoglycaemia as an independent risk factor for MACE
in patients with T2DM and coronary disease is needed.

Our aim was to assess optimal on-treatment blood pressure (BP) at which
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality risks are minimized in
Japanese older adults with isolated systolic hypertension. We used data from the 
VALISH study (Valsartan in Elderly Isolated Systolic Hypertension) that recruited
older adults (n=3035; mean age, 76 years) with systolic BP (SBP) of ≥160 mm Hg
and diastolic BP of <90 mm Hg. Patients were treated by valsartan. Patients were 
also categorized into 3 groups based on achieved on-treatment SBP of <130 mm Hg
(n=317), 130 to <145 mm Hg (n=2025), or ≥145 mm Hg (n=693). The primary outcome
was composite CVD (coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, cardiovascular 
deaths, other vascular diseases, and kidney diseases) with secondary outcome
being all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess
the CVD risk for each group. Over a median 3-year follow-up (8022 person-years), 
93 CVD events and 52 deaths occurred. Using the on-treatment SBP of 130 to <145
mm Hg as reference stratum, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and 95%
confidence intervals of CVD and all-cause mortality risks for those with SBP<130 
mm Hg were 2.08 (1.12-3.83) and 2.09 (0.93-4.71) and for those with SBP≥145 mm Hg
were 2.29 (1.44-3.62) and 2.51 (1.35-4.66), respectively. On-treatment diastolic 
BP yielded no relationships with CVD or all-cause mortality risk. In conclusion, 
among Japanese older adults with isolated systolic hypertension, SBP in the range
between 130 and 144 mm Hg was associated with minimal adverse outcomes and a
reduction in CVD and all-cause mortality. The BP range will need to be confirmed 
in randomized controlled trials.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

The American Diabetes Association, JDRF, the European Association for the Study
of Diabetes, and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists convened a
research symposium, ""The Differentiation of Diabetes by Pathophysiology, Natural 
History and Prognosis"" on 10-12 October 2015. International experts in genetics, 
immunology, metabolism, endocrinology, and systems biology discussed genetic and 
environmental determinants of type 1 and type 2 diabetes risk and progression, as
well as complications. The participants debated how to determine appropriate
therapeutic approaches based on disease pathophysiology and stage and defined
remaining research gaps hindering a personalized medical approach for diabetes to
drive the field to address these gaps. The authors recommend a structure for data
stratification to define the phenotypes and genotypes of subtypes of diabetes
that will facilitate individualized treatment.

AIMS: Although hypokalaemia is common among patients with heart failure (HF), the
prognostic significance of baseline hypokalaemia and hypokalaemia during
follow-up in HF patients receiving a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) 
remains uncertain.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Results of the EMPHASIS-HF trial in patients (n = 2737) with
HF and reduced EF with mild symptoms, randomized to eplerenone or placebo, were
analysed with regard to the presence or occurrence of hypokalaemia (serum K+ <4.0
mmol/L) and the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF (primary
endpoint). Median follow-up was 21 months. Baseline hypokalaemia and hypokalaemia
during follow-up were common occurrences (19.6% and 40.6%, respectively).
Hypokalaemia during follow-up was associated with worse outcomes in multivariable
analyses [hazard ratio (HR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.52, P =
0.01] without evidence of interaction with eplerenone. In contrast, baseline
hypokalaemia was associated with outcomes in the placebo group (HR 1.37, 95% CI
1.05-1.79, P = 0.02) but not in the eplerenone group (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62-1.23, 
P = 0.44; P for interaction = 0.04). Concurrently, eplerenone was found to be
more protective in patients with baseline hypokalaemia vs. patients without
baseline hypokalaemia compared with placebo (HR 0.44, 95% 0.30-0.64, P < 0.0001
vs. 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.83, P = 0.0001; P for interaction = 0.04). In patients
without baseline hypokalaemia, eplerenone use decreased the rate of hypokalaemia 
during follow-up (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.80, P < 0.001). A potassium level >4.0
mmol/L at 1 month after randomization mediated 26.0% (0.6-51.4%) of the
eplerenone treatment effect (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: In HF patients receiving optimal therapy but not treated with
eplerenone, baseline hypokalaemia was associated with worse outcomes. Conversely,
hypokalaemia amplified the treatment effect of eplerenone.

Mineralocorticoid antagonists in chronic kidney disease.

Chicago Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Current evidence showcases the pathologic effects of excess
aldosterone in promoting glomerular and tubulointerstitial inflammation and
fibrosis through various pathways. The place for mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonists (MRAs) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression is unclear.
RECENT FINDINGS: MRAs further reduce albuminuria and blood pressure in CKD
patients when used in conjunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or
angiotensin receptor blockers. The usage of MRAs as disease-modifying therapy in 
CKD patients has been hampered by concern over worsening kidney function and
hyperkalemia. Recent data from small studies highlight a way that these agents
may be used with no fear of hyperkalemia. Additionally, they have been shown to
further lower blood pressure and albuminuria when hyperkalemia is no longer a
safety issue. Additionally, novel MRAs are in phase 3 clinical trials and these
are discussed.
SUMMARY: MRAs have a clear role in further reducing very high albuminuria when
used with other renin-angiotensin system blockers; however, hyperkalemia is a
limiting factor for the use of MRAs. Use of the new potassium binder patiromer
has facilitated the use of MRAs in CKD, and novel nonsteroidal MRAs are currently
being tested in advanced CKD outcome trials.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular outcomes
in TECOS (Clinical trial reg. no. NCT00790205, clinicaltrials.gov) participants
with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease treated with sitagliptin, a
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, according to baseline estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from 14,671 TECOS participants assigned
in a double-blind design to receive sitagliptin or placebo added to existing
therapy, while aiming for glycemic equipoise between groups. Cardiovascular and
CKD outcomes were evaluated over a median period of 3 years, with participants
categorized at baseline into eGFR stages 1, 2, 3a, and 3b (≥90, 60-89, 45-59, or 
30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively).
RESULTS: Participants with eGFR stage 3b were older, were more often female, and 
had a longer duration of diabetes. Four-point major adverse cardiovascular event 
rates increased with lower baseline eGFR (3.52, 3.55, 5.74, and 7.34 events/100
patient-years for stages 1-3b, respectively). Corresponding adjusted hazard
ratios for stages 2, 3a, and 3b versus stage 1 were 0.93 (95% CI 0.82-1.06), 1.28
(1.10-1.49), and 1.39 (1.13-1.72), respectively. Sitagliptin therapy was not
associated with cardiovascular outcomes for any eGFR stage (interaction P values 
were all >0.44). Kidney function declined at the same rate in both treatment
groups, with a marginally lower but constant eGFR difference (-1.3 mL/min/1.73
m2) in those participants who were assigned to sitagliptin. Treatment differences
in these eGFR values remained after adjustment for region, baseline eGFR,
baseline HbA1c, time of assessment, and within-study HbA1c levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Impaired kidney function is associated with worse cardiovascular
outcomes. Sitagliptin has no clinically significant impact on cardiovascular or
CKD outcomes, irrespective of baseline eGFR.

Over the past 7 years, prospective cohorts and small randomized controlled
studies showed that renal denervation therapy (RDN) in patients with resistant
hypertension is safe but associated with variable effects on BP which are not
substantially better than medical therapy alone. The failure of the most
rigorously designed randomized sham-control study, SYMPLICITY HTN-3, to meet the 
efficacy endpoints has raised several methodological concerns. However, recently 
reported studies and ongoing trials with improved procedural characteristics,
identification of patients with true treatment-resistant hypertension on
appropriate antihypertensive regimens further explore potential benefits of RDN. 
The scope of this review is to summarize evidence from currently completed
studies on RDN and discuss future perspectives of RDN therapy in patients with
resistant hypertension.

Activation of the sympathetic nervous system when there is dipeptidyl peptidase 4
inhibition in the presence of high-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibition has led to concerns of potential increases in cardiovascular events
when the 2 classes of drugs are coadministered. We evaluated cardiovascular
outcomes from the EXAMINE (Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes With Alogliptin
versus Standard of Care) trial according to ACE inhibitor use. Patients with type
2 diabetes mellitus and a recent acute coronary syndrome were randomly assigned
to receive the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor alogliptin or placebo added to
existing antihyperglycemic and cardiovascular prophylactic therapies. Risks of
adjudicated cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke, and 
hospitalized heart failure were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model
in patients according to ACE inhibitor use and dose. There were 3323 (62%)
EXAMINE patients treated with an ACE inhibitor (1681 on alogliptin and 1642 on
placebo). The composite rates of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial
infarction, and nonfatal stroke were comparable for alogliptin and placebo with
ACE inhibitor (11.4% versus 11.8%; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval,
0.79-1.19; P=0.76) and without ACE inhibitor use (11.2% versus 11.9%; hazard
ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-1.21; P=0.62). Composite rates for
cardiovascular death and heart failure in patients on ACE inhibitor occurred in
6.8% of patients on alogliptin versus 7.2% on placebo (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95%
confidence interval, 0.72-1.2; P=0.57). There were no differences for these end
points nor for blood pressure or heart rate in patients on higher doses of ACE
inhibitor. Cardiovascular outcomes were similar for alogliptin and placebo in
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary disease treated with ACE
inhibitors.

The Food and Drug Administration issued guidance for evaluating the
cardiovascular risk of new diabetes mellitus drugs in 2008. Accumulating evidence
from several completed trials conducted within this framework raises questions as
to whether requiring safety outcome studies for all new diabetes mellitus
therapies remains justified. Given the burden of cardiovascular disease in
patients with diabetes, the focus should shift towards cardiovascular outcome
studies designed to evaluate efficacy (i.e. to determine the efficacy of a drug
over placebo or standard care) rather than demonstrating that risk is not
increased by a pre-specified safety margin. All stakeholders are responsible for 
ensuring that new drug approvals occur under conditions of appropriate safety and
effectiveness. It is also a shared responsibility to avoid unnecessary hurdles
that may compromise access to useful drugs and threaten the sustainability of
health systems. It is critical to renew this debate so that stakeholders can
collectively determine the optimal approach for developing new drugs to treat
type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Elevated serum aldosterone can be vasculotoxic and facilitate cardiorenal damage.
Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors reduce serum aldosterone levels and/or block 
its effects but can cause hyperkalemia. Patiromer, a nonabsorbed potassium
binder, decreases serum potassium in patients with chronic kidney disease on
renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Here we examined the effect of patiromer
treatment on serum aldosterone, blood pressure, and albuminuria in patients with 
chronic kidney disease on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors with hyperkalemia
(serum potassium 5.1-6.5 mEq/l). We analyzed data from the phase 3 OPAL-HK study 
(4-week initial treatment phase of 243 patients; 8-week randomized withdrawal
phase of 107 patients). In the treatment phase, the (mean ± standard error) serum
potassium was decreased concordantly with the serum aldosterone (-1.99 ± 0.51
ng/dl), systolic/diastolic blood pressure (-5.64 ± 1.04 mm Hg/-3.84 ± 0.69
mm Hg), and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (-203.7 ± 54.7 mg/g), all in a
statistically significant manner. The change in the plasma renin activity (-0.44 
± 0.63 μg/l/hr) was not significant. In the withdrawal phase, mean aldosterone
levels were sustained with patiromer (+0.23 ± 1.07 ng/dl) and significantly
increased with placebo (+2.78 ± 1.25 ng/dl). Patients on patiromer had
significant reductions in mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure (-6.70 ±
1.59/-2.15 ± 1.06 mm Hg), whereas those on placebo did not (-1.21 ± 1.89
mm Hg/+1.72 ± 1.26 mm Hg). Significant changes in plasma renin activity were
found only in the placebo group (-3.90 ± 1.41 μg/l/hr). Thus, patiromer reduced
serum potassium and aldosterone levels independent of plasma renin activity in
patients with chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia on renin-angiotensin system
inhibitors.

Should Restrictions Be Relaxed for Metformin Use in Chronic Kidney Disease? Yes,

Metformin is and has been considered as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes
for over a quarter of a century. Like other biguanides, metformin can cause a
lactic acidosis that is exceptionally rare but fatal. The likelihood of
metformin-associated lactic acidosis is substantially higher in patients with
kidney impairment and also among those with seemingly normal kidney function who 
are at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Hence, regulatory agencies in many
industrialized nations have maintained strict renal restrictions surrounding
metformin. However, there have been millions of people exposed to metformin for
many years, many of them with serum creatinine values at or close to 1.5 mg/dL
with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) much below 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)
who have not developed lactic acidosis. Thus, there clearly remains controversy
in this area, and there has been heightened pressure to remove the renal
restrictions of metformin. To provide a discussion on the pros and cons of
relaxing the renal restrictions for metformin use, we provide a
Point-Counterpoint. In the preceding point narrative, Drs. Kalantar-Zadeh and
Kovesdy provide their argument that although there is little evidence of the
potential benefits of metformin in kidney disease, just considering the sheer
numbers of metformin users and the high fatality rate of its associated lactic
acidosis, the most appropriate practice is to avoid metformin use in people with 
eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or in those who are at high risk of AKI irrespective of
underlying eGFR. In the counterpoint narrative below, Drs. Bakris and Molitch
argue that the data from a very large analysis demonstrate clearly that serum
creatinine should be supplanted with eGFR as the criteria for metformin use and
that the incidence of lactic acidosis is only elevated in those with a reduced
eGFR who become dehydrated for various reasons or in those exposed to some toxin 
resulting in AKI. Otherwise the data clearly support the use of metformin under
normal circumstances down to eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)-William T. CefaluEditor in

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death in all Examination 
of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE)
study participants and in those who experienced an on-study, major nonfatal CV
event.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study randomly assigned 5,380 patients with type
2 diabetes to alogliptin or placebo within 15 to 90 days of an acute coronary
syndrome (ACS). Deaths and nonfatal CV events (myocardial infarction [MI],
stroke, hospitalized heart failure [HHF], and hospitalization for unstable angina
[UA]) were adjudicated. Patients were monitored until censoring or death,
regardless of a prior postrandomized nonfatal CV event. Time-updated
multivariable Cox models were used to estimate the risk of death in the absence
of or after each nonfatal event.
RESULTS: Rates of CV death were 4.1% for alogliptin and 4.9% for placebo (hazard 
ratio [HR] 0.85; 95% CI 0.66, 1.10). A total of 736 patients (13.7%) experienced 
a first nonfatal CV event (5.9% MI, 1.1% stroke, 3.0% HHF, and 3.8% UA). Compared
with patients not experiencing a nonfatal event, the adjusted HR (95% CI) for
death was 3.12 after MI (2.13, 4.58; P < 0.0001) 4.96 after HHF (3.29, 7.47; P < 
0.0001), 3.08 after stroke (1.29, 7.37; P = 0.011), and 1.66 after UA (0.81,
3.37; P = 0.164). Mortality rates after a nonfatal event were comparable for
alogliptin and placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes and a recent ACS, the risk of CV
death was higher after a postrandomization, nonfatal CV event, particularly heart
failure, compared with those who did not experience a CV event. The risk of CV
death was similar between alogliptin and placebo.

BACKGROUND: Performing advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in the cardiac
catheterization laboratory (CCL) is challenging. Mechanical chest compression
(MCC) devices deliver compressions in a small space, allowing for simultaneous
percutaneous coronary intervention and reduced radiation exposure to rescuers. In
refractory cases, MCC devices allow rescuers to initiate percutaneous mechanical 
circulatory support (MCS) and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) during
resuscitation. This study sought to assess the efficacy and safety of MCC when
compared to manual compressions in the CCL.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who received ACLS in
the CCL at our institution between May 2011 and February 2016. Baseline
characteristics, resuscitation details, and outcomes were compared between
patients who received manual and mechanical compressions.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients (67% male, mean age 58 years) required chest
compressions for cardiac arrest while in the CCL (12 manual and 31 MCC). Patients
receiving MCC were more likely to achieve return of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC) (74% vs. 42%, p=0.05). Of those receiving MCC, twenty-two patients (71%)
were treated with MCS. Patients receiving percutaneous ECLS were more likely to
achieve ROSC (100% vs. 53%, p=0.003) and suffered no episodes of limb loss or
TIMI major bleeding. There were no significant differences in 30-day survival or 
survival to hospital discharge between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of MCC during resuscitation of cardiac arrest in the CCL
increases the rate of ROSC. Simultaneous implantation of MCS, including
percutaneous ECLS, is feasible and safe during MCC-assisted resuscitation in the 
CCL.

The CommunityRx system, a population health innovation, combined an e-prescribing
model and community engagement to strengthen links between clinics and community 
resources for basic, wellness, and disease self-management needs in Chicago. The 
components of CommunityRx were a youth workforce, whose members identified 19,589
public-serving entities in the 106-square-mile implementation region between 2012
and 2014; community health information specialists, who used the workforce's
findings to generate an inventory of 14,914 health-promoting resources; and a
health information technology (IT) platform that was integrated with three
electronic health record systems at thirty-three clinical sites. By mapping
thirty-seven prevalent social and medical conditions to community resources,
CommunityRx generated 253,479 personalized HealtheRx prescriptions for more than 
113,000 participants. Eighty-three percent of the recipients found the HealtheRx 
very useful, and 19 percent went to a place they learned about from the
HealtheRx. All but one organization continued using the CommunityRx system after 
the study period ended. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using health
IT and workforce innovation to bridge the gap between clinical and other
health-promoting sectors.

BACKGROUND: Current quality of life assessment tools for thyroid cancer survivors
are not clinically useful due to the length of available questionnaires.
Computerized adaptive tests are easily administered electronically and can
achieve highly accurate and efficient results in minimal time. We aimed to
develop a quality of life computerized adaptive tests (ThyCAT) for thyroid cancer
survivors.
METHODS: A bifactor item response theory model was fit to questionnaire responses
from 1,078 North American Thyroid Cancer Survivorship Study participants-a
longitudinal cohort study of quality of life in thyroid cancer survivors. Tuning 
parameters were selected to maintain a correlation of r > 0.9 with the total item
bank quality of life score obtained from the original North American Thyroid
Cancer Survivorship Study questions, using a minimal number of adaptively
administered ThyCAT items.
RESULTS: The ThyCAT assesses quality of life with strong correlation (r = 0.96)
with the original 75 North American Thyroid Cancer Survivorship Study questions
using an average of 9.94 questions (SD ± 3.03) administered in <2 minutes. There 
was no statistically significant difference in the number of ThyCAT questions
required based on demographic or tumor characteristics.
CONCLUSION: The ThyCAT can be administered on a smartphone app in <10 questions, 
and <2 minutes, allowing efficient and accurate in or out of clinic
identification of patients struggling with quality of life issues after thyroid
cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid-related mortality has remained constant despite the
increasing incidence of thyroid carcinoma. Most thyroid nodules are benign;
therefore, ultrasound and fine needle aspiration (FNA) are integral in cancer
screening. We hypothesize that increased nodule size at ultrasound does not
predict malignancy and correlation between nodule size at ultrasound and
pathologic exam is good.
METHODS: Resected thyroids with preoperative ultrasounds were identified. Nodule 
size at ultrasound, FNA diagnosis by Bethesda category, size at pathologic
examination, and final histologic diagnosis were recorded. Nodule characteristics
at ultrasound and FNA diagnoses were correlated with gross characteristics and
histologic diagnoses. Nodules for which correlation could not be established were
excluded.
RESULTS: Of 1003 nodules from 659 patients, 26% were malignant. Nodules <2 cm had
the highest malignancy rate (∼30%). Risk was similar (∼20%) for nodules ≥2 cm. Of
the 548 subject to FNA, 38% were malignant. Decreasing malignancy rates were
observed with increasing size (57% for nodules <1 cm to 20% for nodules >6 cm).
At ultrasound size cutoffs of 2, 3, 4, and 5 cm, smaller nodules had higher
malignancy rates than larger nodules. Of the 455 not subject to FNA, 11% were
malignant. Ultrasound size alone is a poor predictor of malignancy, but a
relatively good predictor of final pathologic size (R2 = 0.748), with less
correlation at larger sizes. In nodules subject to FNA, false negative diagnoses 
were highest (6-8%) in nodules 3-6 cm, mostly due to encapsulated follicular
variant of papillary carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid nodule size is inversely related to malignancy risk, as
larger nodules have lower malignancy rates. However, the relationship of size to 
malignancy varies by FNA status. All nodules (regardless of FNA status)
demonstrate a risk trough at ≥2 cm. Nodules subject to FNA show step-wise decline
in malignancy rates by size, demonstrating that size alone should not be
considered as an independent risk factor. Size at ultrasound shows relatively
good correlation with final pathologic size. False negative rates are low in this
series. Lesions with the appropriate constellation of clinical and radiographic
findings should undergo FNA regardless of size. Both size and FNA diagnosis
should influence the clinical decision-making process.

    Surgery. 2017 Jan;161(1):67-69.

BACKGROUND: Normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism presents diagnostic and
intraoperative challenges, and current literature is conflicting about
management. We aim to better define normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism in 
order to improve the care for these patients.
METHODS: In the study, 516 consecutive patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for 
primary hyperparathyroidism were divided into 2 groups: classic primary
hyperparathyroidism (classic primary hyperparathyroidism, increased serum levels 
of calcium, and parathyroid hormone) and normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia, normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone). 
We evaluated inter-group differences in presentation, gland weight, pathology,
and complications.
RESULTS: The normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism group was comprised of 116
(22.5%) patients. Mean serum levels of parathyroid hormone and calcium were 62.1 
pg/mL ± 10.1 and 10.6 mg/dL ± 0.63 in normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism, 
and 142 ± 89.0pg/mL and 11.0 ± 0.88 (both P < .01) for classic primary
hyperparathyroidism. Nephrolithiasis was more common in normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism. Multigland hyperplasia was more common in
normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism 23 (19.8%) vs 44 (11%; P = .04).
Concordant imaging studies were less likely in normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism (82 [73.2%] vs 337 [87.1%; P < .01]), had a lesser total
gland weight (531.8 mg ± 680.0 vs 1,039.6 mg ± 1,237.3; P < .01), and lesser
2-week parathyroid hormone (32.5 pg/mL ± 18.95 vs 41.0 pg/mL ± 27.8; P = .01).
There was no difference in hypoparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone <15 pg/mL;
P = .93) at 2 weeks postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism represents 22.5% of our
primary hyperparathyroidism population, which is greater than reported
previously. It is a distinct disease process from classic primary
hyperparathyroidism in presentation, imaging, and operative findings. More
hyperplasia and a lesser gland weight make it challenging to resect the ideal
amount of tissue. Studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine
optimal operative management.

Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm with some
morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence of epithelial differentiation. The
""classic"" subtype occurs in younger patients, often in distal extremities as
compared with the ""proximal"" type. Tumors of the proximal type primarily arising 
in solid organs are rare with only few case reports in the literature. We report 
2 cases of primary ES in the kidney of a 27-year-old woman and the adrenal gland 
of a 73-year-old man. Clinical examination and imaging, including computed
tomography and positron-emission tomography, did not reveal tumor elsewhere in
both cases. Histologic features were those of ES, proximal type with
epithelioid/rhabdoid phenotype. Immunohistochemical study in both cases showed
strong, diffuse expression of epithelial markers, CD34, and CD31. Nuclear
expression of SMARCB1 protein was lost, but fluorescence in situ hybridization
analysis was negative for SMARCB1 deletion. We believe that these are the first
reports of primary kidney and adrenal gland ES.

BACKGROUND: With over 110,000 bariatric operations performed in the United States
annually, it is important to understand the biochemical abnormalities causing
endocrine dysfunction associated with these procedures. Here we compare 2
malabsorptive procedures, duodenal switch and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, to
determine the role malabsorption plays in secondary hyperparathyroidism in this
population.
METHODS: Data from all super-obese patients undergoing duodenal switch or
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between August 2002 and October 2005 were prospectively 
collected. Postoperatively, all patients received 1,200 mg of calcium citrate and
1,000 IU vitamin D3 per American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery
guidelines. Beginning in 2007, duodenal switch patients were instructed to add
daily vitamin D3 10,000 IU. Statistical analyses included Student t test,
multivariate, and univariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 283 patients with a body mass index ≥50, 170 (60.1%) underwent
duodenal switch, while 113 (39.9%) underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Of 132
(46.6%) patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, 101 (59.4%) had undergone
duodenal switch and 31 (27.4%) had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Symptoms
were more common in the duodenal switch group (33 patients [19.4%]) than
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (11 patients [9.7%]). Multivariate logistic regression
demonstrated that the extent of bypass and duration of follow-up were the only 2 
independent predictive risk factors for developing secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Although vitamin D levels improved with increased vitamin D3 supplementation in
2007, rates of secondary hyperparathyroidism increased.
CONCLUSION: Despite routine postoperative calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation,
secondary hyperparathyroidism is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and
duodenal switch. The degree of iatrogenic malabsorption correlates with the
incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism. These rates suggest current
supplementation guidelines are not sufficient in preventing secondary
hyperparathyroidism. Further work is needed to better define the sequelae of
long-term hyperparathyroidism.

BACKGROUND: Radiation is a well-described risk factor for differentiated thyroid 
carcinoma (DTC). Although the natural history of DTC following nuclear disasters 
and in healthcare workers with chronic radiation exposure (RE) has been
described, little is known about DTC following short-term exposure to therapeutic
medical radiation for benign disease. This study compares DTC morphology and
outcomes in patients with and without a prior history of therapeutic external RE.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients with DTC treated at The
University of Chicago between 1951 and 1987, with a median follow-up of 27 years 
(range 0.3-60 years). Patients were classified as either having (RE+) or not
having (RE-) a history of therapeutic RE. Variables examined included sex, age at
RE, dose of RE, indication for RE, DTC histology, and outcome. Morphology was
determined by blinded retrospective review of all available histologic slides.
Outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier
curves.
RESULTS: Of 257 DTC patients, 165 (64%) were RE- and 92 (36%) were RE+, with
males comprising a greater proportion of the RE+ group (43.5% vs. 27.3%;
p = 0.01). A total of 94.2% of DTC cases were classic papillary cancers;
histology did not differ between RE+ and RE- cohorts (p = 0.73). RE was
associated with an increased median overall survival (OS; 43 years vs. 38 years; 
hazard ratio [HR] = 0.55 [confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.89]; p = 0.01).
Survival for males in the RE- group was significantly worse than it was for RE-
females (HR = 1.78 [CI 1.05-3.03]; p = 0.03) or RE+ males (HR = 2.98 [CI
1.39-6.38]; p = 0.01). Recurrence did not differ between the RE+ and RE- groups
(HR = 0.85 [CI 0.52-1.41]; p = 0.54), nor did DTC-specific mortality (HR = 0.54
[CI 0.21-1.37]; p = 0.20).
CONCLUSIONS: While DTC following RE has historically been considered a more
aggressive variant than DTC in the absence of RE, the present data indicate that 
RE+ DTC is associated with better OS than RE- DTC, especially for males.
Additionally, recent reports are confirmed of equivalent rates of thyroid cancer 
recurrence. These results warrant further investigation into the factors
underlying this unexpected finding.

malignant. Ultrasound size alone is a poor predictor of malignancy, but a
relatively good predictor of final pathologic size (R2 = 0.748), with less
correlation at larger sizes. In nodules subject to FNA, false negative diagnoses 
were highest (6-8%) in nodules 3-6 cm, mostly due to encapsulated follicular
variant of papillary carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid nodule size is inversely related to malignancy risk, as
larger nodules have lower malignancy rates. However, the relationship of size to 
malignancy varies by FNA status. All nodules (regardless of FNA status)
demonstrate a risk trough at ≥2 cm. Nodules subject to FNA show step-wise decline
in malignancy rates by size, demonstrating that size alone should not be
considered as an independent risk factor. Size at ultrasound shows relatively
good correlation with final pathologic size. False negative rates are low in this
series. Lesions with the appropriate constellation of clinical and radiographic
findings should undergo FNA regardless of size. Both size and FNA diagnosis
should influence the clinical decision-making process.

BACKGROUND: Normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism presents diagnostic and
intraoperative challenges, and current literature is conflicting about
management. We aim to better define normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism in 
order to improve the care for these patients.
METHODS: In the study, 516 consecutive patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for 
primary hyperparathyroidism were divided into 2 groups: classic primary
hyperparathyroidism (classic primary hyperparathyroidism, increased serum levels 
of calcium, and parathyroid hormone) and normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia, normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone). 
We evaluated inter-group differences in presentation, gland weight, pathology,
and complications.
RESULTS: The normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism group was comprised of 116
(22.5%) patients. Mean serum levels of parathyroid hormone and calcium were 62.1 
pg/mL ± 10.1 and 10.6 mg/dL ± 0.63 in normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism, 
and 142 ± 89.0pg/mL and 11.0 ± 0.88 (both P < .01) for classic primary
hyperparathyroidism. Nephrolithiasis was more common in normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism. Multigland hyperplasia was more common in
normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism 23 (19.8%) vs 44 (11%; P = .04).
Concordant imaging studies were less likely in normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism (82 [73.2%] vs 337 [87.1%; P < .01]), had a lesser total
gland weight (531.8 mg ± 680.0 vs 1,039.6 mg ± 1,237.3; P < .01), and lesser
2-week parathyroid hormone (32.5 pg/mL ± 18.95 vs 41.0 pg/mL ± 27.8; P = .01).
There was no difference in hypoparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone <15 pg/mL;
P = .93) at 2 weeks postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism represents 22.5% of our
primary hyperparathyroidism population, which is greater than reported
previously. It is a distinct disease process from classic primary
hyperparathyroidism in presentation, imaging, and operative findings. More
hyperplasia and a lesser gland weight make it challenging to resect the ideal
amount of tissue. Studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine
optimal operative management.

Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm with some
morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence of epithelial differentiation. The
""classic"" subtype occurs in younger patients, often in distal extremities as
compared with the ""proximal"" type. Tumors of the proximal type primarily arising 
in solid organs are rare with only few case reports in the literature. We report 
2 cases of primary ES in the kidney of a 27-year-old woman and the adrenal gland 
of a 73-year-old man. Clinical examination and imaging, including computed
tomography and positron-emission tomography, did not reveal tumor elsewhere in
both cases. Histologic features were those of ES, proximal type with
epithelioid/rhabdoid phenotype. Immunohistochemical study in both cases showed
strong, diffuse expression of epithelial markers, CD34, and CD31. Nuclear
expression of SMARCB1 protein was lost, but fluorescence in situ hybridization
analysis was negative for SMARCB1 deletion. We believe that these are the first
reports of primary kidney and adrenal gland ES.

BACKGROUND: With over 110,000 bariatric operations performed in the United States
annually, it is important to understand the biochemical abnormalities causing
endocrine dysfunction associated with these procedures. Here we compare 2
malabsorptive procedures, duodenal switch and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, to
determine the role malabsorption plays in secondary hyperparathyroidism in this
population.
METHODS: Data from all super-obese patients undergoing duodenal switch or
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between August 2002 and October 2005 were prospectively 
collected. Postoperatively, all patients received 1,200 mg of calcium citrate and
1,000 IU vitamin D3 per American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery
guidelines. Beginning in 2007, duodenal switch patients were instructed to add
daily vitamin D3 10,000 IU. Statistical analyses included Student t test,
multivariate, and univariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 283 patients with a body mass index ≥50, 170 (60.1%) underwent
duodenal switch, while 113 (39.9%) underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Of 132
(46.6%) patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, 101 (59.4%) had undergone
duodenal switch and 31 (27.4%) had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Symptoms
were more common in the duodenal switch group (33 patients [19.4%]) than
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (11 patients [9.7%]). Multivariate logistic regression
demonstrated that the extent of bypass and duration of follow-up were the only 2 
independent predictive risk factors for developing secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Although vitamin D levels improved with increased vitamin D3 supplementation in
2007, rates of secondary hyperparathyroidism increased.
CONCLUSION: Despite routine postoperative calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation,
secondary hyperparathyroidism is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and
duodenal switch. The degree of iatrogenic malabsorption correlates with the
incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism. These rates suggest current
supplementation guidelines are not sufficient in preventing secondary
hyperparathyroidism. Further work is needed to better define the sequelae of
long-term hyperparathyroidism.

BACKGROUND: Radiation is a well-described risk factor for differentiated thyroid 
carcinoma (DTC). Although the natural history of DTC following nuclear disasters 
and in healthcare workers with chronic radiation exposure (RE) has been
described, little is known about DTC following short-term exposure to therapeutic
medical radiation for benign disease. This study compares DTC morphology and
outcomes in patients with and without a prior history of therapeutic external RE.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients with DTC treated at The
University of Chicago between 1951 and 1987, with a median follow-up of 27 years 
(range 0.3-60 years). Patients were classified as either having (RE+) or not
having (RE-) a history of therapeutic RE. Variables examined included sex, age at
RE, dose of RE, indication for RE, DTC histology, and outcome. Morphology was
determined by blinded retrospective review of all available histologic slides.
Outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier
curves.
RESULTS: Of 257 DTC patients, 165 (64%) were RE- and 92 (36%) were RE+, with
males comprising a greater proportion of the RE+ group (43.5% vs. 27.3%;
p = 0.01). A total of 94.2% of DTC cases were classic papillary cancers;
histology did not differ between RE+ and RE- cohorts (p = 0.73). RE was
associated with an increased median overall survival (OS; 43 years vs. 38 years; 
hazard ratio [HR] = 0.55 [confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.89]; p = 0.01).
Survival for males in the RE- group was significantly worse than it was for RE-
females (HR = 1.78 [CI 1.05-3.03]; p = 0.03) or RE+ males (HR = 2.98 [CI
1.39-6.38]; p = 0.01). Recurrence did not differ between the RE+ and RE- groups
(HR = 0.85 [CI 0.52-1.41]; p = 0.54), nor did DTC-specific mortality (HR = 0.54
[CI 0.21-1.37]; p = 0.20).
CONCLUSIONS: While DTC following RE has historically been considered a more
aggressive variant than DTC in the absence of RE, the present data indicate that 
RE+ DTC is associated with better OS than RE- DTC, especially for males.
Additionally, recent reports are confirmed of equivalent rates of thyroid cancer 
recurrence. These results warrant further investigation into the factors
underlying this unexpected finding.

BACKGROUND: Current quality of life assessment tools for thyroid cancer survivors
are not clinically useful due to the length of available questionnaires.
Computerized adaptive tests are easily administered electronically and can
achieve highly accurate and efficient results in minimal time. We aimed to
develop a quality of life computerized adaptive tests (ThyCAT) for thyroid cancer
survivors.
METHODS: A bifactor item response theory model was fit to questionnaire responses
from 1,078 North American Thyroid Cancer Survivorship Study participants-a
longitudinal cohort study of quality of life in thyroid cancer survivors. Tuning 
parameters were selected to maintain a correlation of r > 0.9 with the total item
bank quality of life score obtained from the original North American Thyroid
Cancer Survivorship Study questions, using a minimal number of adaptively
administered ThyCAT items.
RESULTS: The ThyCAT assesses quality of life with strong correlation (r = 0.96)
with the original 75 North American Thyroid Cancer Survivorship Study questions
using an average of 9.94 questions (SD ± 3.03) administered in <2 minutes. There 
was no statistically significant difference in the number of ThyCAT questions
required based on demographic or tumor characteristics.
CONCLUSION: The ThyCAT can be administered on a smartphone app in <10 questions, 
and <2 minutes, allowing efficient and accurate in or out of clinic
identification of patients struggling with quality of life issues after thyroid
cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid-related mortality has remained constant despite the
increasing incidence of thyroid carcinoma. Most thyroid nodules are benign;
therefore, ultrasound and fine needle aspiration (FNA) are integral in cancer
screening. We hypothesize that increased nodule size at ultrasound does not
predict malignancy and correlation between nodule size at ultrasound and
pathologic exam is good.
METHODS: Resected thyroids with preoperative ultrasounds were identified. Nodule 
size at ultrasound, FNA diagnosis by Bethesda category, size at pathologic
examination, and final histologic diagnosis were recorded. Nodule characteristics
at ultrasound and FNA diagnoses were correlated with gross characteristics and
histologic diagnoses. Nodules for which correlation could not be established were
excluded.
RESULTS: Of 1003 nodules from 659 patients, 26% were malignant. Nodules <2 cm had
the highest malignancy rate (∼30%). Risk was similar (∼20%) for nodules ≥2 cm. Of
the 548 subject to FNA, 38% were malignant. Decreasing malignancy rates were
observed with increasing size (57% for nodules <1 cm to 20% for nodules >6 cm).
At ultrasound size cutoffs of 2, 3, 4, and 5 cm, smaller nodules had higher
malignancy rates than larger nodules. Of the 455 not subject to FNA, 11% were
malignant. Ultrasound size alone is a poor predictor of malignancy, but a
relatively good predictor of final pathologic size (R2 = 0.748), with less
correlation at larger sizes. In nodules subject to FNA, false negative diagnoses

CONCLUSION: Despite routine postoperative calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation,
secondary hyperparathyroidism is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and
duodenal switch. The degree of iatrogenic malabsorption correlates with the
incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism. These rates suggest current
supplementation guidelines are not sufficient in preventing secondary
hyperparathyroidism. Further work is needed to better define the sequelae of
long-term hyperparathyroidism.

BACKGROUND: Radiation is a well-described risk factor for differentiated thyroid 
carcinoma (DTC). Although the natural history of DTC following nuclear disasters 
and in healthcare workers with chronic radiation exposure (RE) has been
described, little is known about DTC following short-term exposure to therapeutic
medical radiation for benign disease. This study compares DTC morphology and
outcomes in patients with and without a prior history of therapeutic external RE.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients with DTC treated at The
University of Chicago between 1951 and 1987, with a median follow-up of 27 years 
(range 0.3-60 years). Patients were classified as either having (RE+) or not
having (RE-) a history of therapeutic RE. Variables examined included sex, age at
RE, dose of RE, indication for RE, DTC histology, and outcome. Morphology was
determined by blinded retrospective review of all available histologic slides.
Outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier
curves.
RESULTS: Of 257 DTC patients, 165 (64%) were RE- and 92 (36%) were RE+, with
males comprising a greater proportion of the RE+ group (43.5% vs. 27.3%;
p = 0.01). A total of 94.2% of DTC cases were classic papillary cancers;
histology did not differ between RE+ and RE- cohorts (p = 0.73). RE was
associated with an increased median overall survival (OS; 43 years vs. 38 years; 
hazard ratio [HR] = 0.55 [confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.89]; p = 0.01).
Survival for males in the RE- group was significantly worse than it was for RE-
females (HR = 1.78 [CI 1.05-3.03]; p = 0.03) or RE+ males (HR = 2.98 [CI
1.39-6.38]; p = 0.01). Recurrence did not differ between the RE+ and RE- groups
(HR = 0.85 [CI 0.52-1.41]; p = 0.54), nor did DTC-specific mortality (HR = 0.54
[CI 0.21-1.37]; p = 0.20).
CONCLUSIONS: While DTC following RE has historically been considered a more
aggressive variant than DTC in the absence of RE, the present data indicate that 
RE+ DTC is associated with better OS than RE- DTC, especially for males.
Additionally, recent reports are confirmed of equivalent rates of thyroid cancer 
recurrence. These results warrant further investigation into the factors
underlying this unexpected finding.

BACKGROUND: Current quality of life assessment tools for thyroid cancer survivors
are not clinically useful due to the length of available questionnaires.
Computerized adaptive tests are easily administered electronically and can
achieve highly accurate and efficient results in minimal time. We aimed to
develop a quality of life computerized adaptive tests (ThyCAT) for thyroid cancer
survivors.
METHODS: A bifactor item response theory model was fit to questionnaire responses
from 1,078 North American Thyroid Cancer Survivorship Study participants-a
longitudinal cohort study of quality of life in thyroid cancer survivors. Tuning 
parameters were selected to maintain a correlation of r > 0.9 with the total item
bank quality of life score obtained from the original North American Thyroid
Cancer Survivorship Study questions, using a minimal number of adaptively
administered ThyCAT items.
RESULTS: The ThyCAT assesses quality of life with strong correlation (r = 0.96)
with the original 75 North American Thyroid Cancer Survivorship Study questions
using an average of 9.94 questions (SD ± 3.03) administered in <2 minutes. There 
was no statistically significant difference in the number of ThyCAT questions
required based on demographic or tumor characteristics.
CONCLUSION: The ThyCAT can be administered on a smartphone app in <10 questions, 
and <2 minutes, allowing efficient and accurate in or out of clinic
identification of patients struggling with quality of life issues after thyroid
cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid-related mortality has remained constant despite the
increasing incidence of thyroid carcinoma. Most thyroid nodules are benign;
therefore, ultrasound and fine needle aspiration (FNA) are integral in cancer
screening. We hypothesize that increased nodule size at ultrasound does not
predict malignancy and correlation between nodule size at ultrasound and
pathologic exam is good.
METHODS: Resected thyroids with preoperative ultrasounds were identified. Nodule 
size at ultrasound, FNA diagnosis by Bethesda category, size at pathologic
examination, and final histologic diagnosis were recorded. Nodule characteristics
at ultrasound and FNA diagnoses were correlated with gross characteristics and
histologic diagnoses. Nodules for which correlation could not be established were
excluded.
RESULTS: Of 1003 nodules from 659 patients, 26% were malignant. Nodules <2 cm had
the highest malignancy rate (∼30%). Risk was similar (∼20%) for nodules ≥2 cm. Of
the 548 subject to FNA, 38% were malignant. Decreasing malignancy rates were
observed with increasing size (57% for nodules <1 cm to 20% for nodules >6 cm).
At ultrasound size cutoffs of 2, 3, 4, and 5 cm, smaller nodules had higher
malignancy rates than larger nodules. Of the 455 not subject to FNA, 11% were
malignant. Ultrasound size alone is a poor predictor of malignancy, but a
relatively good predictor of final pathologic size (R2 = 0.748), with less
correlation at larger sizes. In nodules subject to FNA, false negative diagnoses 
were highest (6-8%) in nodules 3-6 cm, mostly due to encapsulated follicular
variant of papillary carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid nodule size is inversely related to malignancy risk, as
larger nodules have lower malignancy rates. However, the relationship of size to 
malignancy varies by FNA status. All nodules (regardless of FNA status)
demonstrate a risk trough at ≥2 cm. Nodules subject to FNA show step-wise decline
in malignancy rates by size, demonstrating that size alone should not be
considered as an independent risk factor. Size at ultrasound shows relatively
good correlation with final pathologic size. False negative rates are low in this
series. Lesions with the appropriate constellation of clinical and radiographic
findings should undergo FNA regardless of size. Both size and FNA diagnosis
should influence the clinical decision-making process.

    Surgery. 2017 Jan;161(1):67-69.

BACKGROUND: Normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism presents diagnostic and
intraoperative challenges, and current literature is conflicting about
management. We aim to better define normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism in 
order to improve the care for these patients.
METHODS: In the study, 516 consecutive patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for 
primary hyperparathyroidism were divided into 2 groups: classic primary
hyperparathyroidism (classic primary hyperparathyroidism, increased serum levels 
of calcium, and parathyroid hormone) and normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia, normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone). 
We evaluated inter-group differences in presentation, gland weight, pathology,
and complications.
RESULTS: The normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism group was comprised of 116
(22.5%) patients. Mean serum levels of parathyroid hormone and calcium were 62.1 
pg/mL ± 10.1 and 10.6 mg/dL ± 0.63 in normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism, 
and 142 ± 89.0pg/mL and 11.0 ± 0.88 (both P < .01) for classic primary
hyperparathyroidism. Nephrolithiasis was more common in normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism. Multigland hyperplasia was more common in
normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism 23 (19.8%) vs 44 (11%; P = .04).
Concordant imaging studies were less likely in normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism (82 [73.2%] vs 337 [87.1%; P < .01]), had a lesser total
gland weight (531.8 mg ± 680.0 vs 1,039.6 mg ± 1,237.3; P < .01), and lesser
2-week parathyroid hormone (32.5 pg/mL ± 18.95 vs 41.0 pg/mL ± 27.8; P = .01).
There was no difference in hypoparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone <15 pg/mL;
P = .93) at 2 weeks postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism represents 22.5% of our
primary hyperparathyroidism population, which is greater than reported
previously. It is a distinct disease process from classic primary
hyperparathyroidism in presentation, imaging, and operative findings. More
hyperplasia and a lesser gland weight make it challenging to resect the ideal
amount of tissue. Studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine
optimal operative management.

Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm with some
morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence of epithelial differentiation. The
""classic"" subtype occurs in younger patients, often in distal extremities as
compared with the ""proximal"" type. Tumors of the proximal type primarily arising 
in solid organs are rare with only few case reports in the literature. We report 
2 cases of primary ES in the kidney of a 27-year-old woman and the adrenal gland 
of a 73-year-old man. Clinical examination and imaging, including computed
tomography and positron-emission tomography, did not reveal tumor elsewhere in
both cases. Histologic features were those of ES, proximal type with
epithelioid/rhabdoid phenotype. Immunohistochemical study in both cases showed
strong, diffuse expression of epithelial markers, CD34, and CD31. Nuclear
expression of SMARCB1 protein was lost, but fluorescence in situ hybridization
analysis was negative for SMARCB1 deletion. We believe that these are the first
reports of primary kidney and adrenal gland ES.

BACKGROUND: With over 110,000 bariatric operations performed in the United States
annually, it is important to understand the biochemical abnormalities causing
endocrine dysfunction associated with these procedures. Here we compare 2
malabsorptive procedures, duodenal switch and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, to
determine the role malabsorption plays in secondary hyperparathyroidism in this
population.
METHODS: Data from all super-obese patients undergoing duodenal switch or
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between August 2002 and October 2005 were prospectively 
collected. Postoperatively, all patients received 1,200 mg of calcium citrate and
1,000 IU vitamin D3 per American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery
guidelines. Beginning in 2007, duodenal switch patients were instructed to add
daily vitamin D3 10,000 IU. Statistical analyses included Student t test,
multivariate, and univariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 283 patients with a body mass index ≥50, 170 (60.1%) underwent
duodenal switch, while 113 (39.9%) underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Of 132
(46.6%) patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, 101 (59.4%) had undergone
duodenal switch and 31 (27.4%) had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Symptoms
were more common in the duodenal switch group (33 patients [19.4%]) than
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (11 patients [9.7%]). Multivariate logistic regression
demonstrated that the extent of bypass and duration of follow-up were the only 2 
independent predictive risk factors for developing secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Although vitamin D levels improved with increased vitamin D3 supplementation in
2007, rates of secondary hyperparathyroidism increased.
CONCLUSION: Despite routine postoperative calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation,
secondary hyperparathyroidism is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and
duodenal switch. The degree of iatrogenic malabsorption correlates with the
incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism. These rates suggest current
supplementation guidelines are not sufficient in preventing secondary
hyperparathyroidism. Further work is needed to better define the sequelae of
long-term hyperparathyroidism.

in malignancy rates by size, demonstrating that size alone should not be
considered as an independent risk factor. Size at ultrasound shows relatively
good correlation with final pathologic size. False negative rates are low in this
series. Lesions with the appropriate constellation of clinical and radiographic
findings should undergo FNA regardless of size. Both size and FNA diagnosis
should influence the clinical decision-making process.

BACKGROUND: Normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism presents diagnostic and
intraoperative challenges, and current literature is conflicting about
management. We aim to better define normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism in 
order to improve the care for these patients.
METHODS: In the study, 516 consecutive patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for 
primary hyperparathyroidism were divided into 2 groups: classic primary
hyperparathyroidism (classic primary hyperparathyroidism, increased serum levels 
of calcium, and parathyroid hormone) and normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia, normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone). 
We evaluated inter-group differences in presentation, gland weight, pathology,
and complications.
RESULTS: The normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism group was comprised of 116
(22.5%) patients. Mean serum levels of parathyroid hormone and calcium were 62.1 
pg/mL ± 10.1 and 10.6 mg/dL ± 0.63 in normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism, 
and 142 ± 89.0pg/mL and 11.0 ± 0.88 (both P < .01) for classic primary
hyperparathyroidism. Nephrolithiasis was more common in normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism. Multigland hyperplasia was more common in
normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism 23 (19.8%) vs 44 (11%; P = .04).
Concordant imaging studies were less likely in normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism (82 [73.2%] vs 337 [87.1%; P < .01]), had a lesser total
gland weight (531.8 mg ± 680.0 vs 1,039.6 mg ± 1,237.3; P < .01), and lesser
2-week parathyroid hormone (32.5 pg/mL ± 18.95 vs 41.0 pg/mL ± 27.8; P = .01).
There was no difference in hypoparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone <15 pg/mL;
P = .93) at 2 weeks postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism represents 22.5% of our
primary hyperparathyroidism population, which is greater than reported
previously. It is a distinct disease process from classic primary
hyperparathyroidism in presentation, imaging, and operative findings. More
hyperplasia and a lesser gland weight make it challenging to resect the ideal
amount of tissue. Studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine
optimal operative management.

Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm with some
morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence of epithelial differentiation. The
""classic"" subtype occurs in younger patients, often in distal extremities as
compared with the ""proximal"" type. Tumors of the proximal type primarily arising 
in solid organs are rare with only few case reports in the literature. We report 
2 cases of primary ES in the kidney of a 27-year-old woman and the adrenal gland 
of a 73-year-old man. Clinical examination and imaging, including computed
tomography and positron-emission tomography, did not reveal tumor elsewhere in
both cases. Histologic features were those of ES, proximal type with
epithelioid/rhabdoid phenotype. Immunohistochemical study in both cases showed
strong, diffuse expression of epithelial markers, CD34, and CD31. Nuclear
expression of SMARCB1 protein was lost, but fluorescence in situ hybridization
analysis was negative for SMARCB1 deletion. We believe that these are the first
reports of primary kidney and adrenal gland ES.

BACKGROUND: With over 110,000 bariatric operations performed in the United States
annually, it is important to understand the biochemical abnormalities causing
endocrine dysfunction associated with these procedures. Here we compare 2
malabsorptive procedures, duodenal switch and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, to
determine the role malabsorption plays in secondary hyperparathyroidism in this
population.
METHODS: Data from all super-obese patients undergoing duodenal switch or
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between August 2002 and October 2005 were prospectively 
collected. Postoperatively, all patients received 1,200 mg of calcium citrate and
1,000 IU vitamin D3 per American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery
guidelines. Beginning in 2007, duodenal switch patients were instructed to add
daily vitamin D3 10,000 IU. Statistical analyses included Student t test,
multivariate, and univariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 283 patients with a body mass index ≥50, 170 (60.1%) underwent
duodenal switch, while 113 (39.9%) underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Of 132
(46.6%) patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, 101 (59.4%) had undergone
duodenal switch and 31 (27.4%) had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Symptoms
were more common in the duodenal switch group (33 patients [19.4%]) than
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (11 patients [9.7%]). Multivariate logistic regression
demonstrated that the extent of bypass and duration of follow-up were the only 2 
independent predictive risk factors for developing secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Although vitamin D levels improved with increased vitamin D3 supplementation in
2007, rates of secondary hyperparathyroidism increased.
CONCLUSION: Despite routine postoperative calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation,
secondary hyperparathyroidism is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and
duodenal switch. The degree of iatrogenic malabsorption correlates with the
incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism. These rates suggest current
supplementation guidelines are not sufficient in preventing secondary
hyperparathyroidism. Further work is needed to better define the sequelae of
long-term hyperparathyroidism.

BACKGROUND: Radiation is a well-described risk factor for differentiated thyroid 
carcinoma (DTC). Although the natural history of DTC following nuclear disasters 
and in healthcare workers with chronic radiation exposure (RE) has been
described, little is known about DTC following short-term exposure to therapeutic
medical radiation for benign disease. This study compares DTC morphology and
outcomes in patients with and without a prior history of therapeutic external RE.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients with DTC treated at The
University of Chicago between 1951 and 1987, with a median follow-up of 27 years 
(range 0.3-60 years). Patients were classified as either having (RE+) or not
having (RE-) a history of therapeutic RE. Variables examined included sex, age at
RE, dose of RE, indication for RE, DTC histology, and outcome. Morphology was
determined by blinded retrospective review of all available histologic slides.
Outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier
curves.
RESULTS: Of 257 DTC patients, 165 (64%) were RE- and 92 (36%) were RE+, with
males comprising a greater proportion of the RE+ group (43.5% vs. 27.3%;
p = 0.01). A total of 94.2% of DTC cases were classic papillary cancers;
histology did not differ between RE+ and RE- cohorts (p = 0.73). RE was
associated with an increased median overall survival (OS; 43 years vs. 38 years; 
hazard ratio [HR] = 0.55 [confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.89]; p = 0.01).
Survival for males in the RE- group was significantly worse than it was for RE-
females (HR = 1.78 [CI 1.05-3.03]; p = 0.03) or RE+ males (HR = 2.98 [CI
1.39-6.38]; p = 0.01). Recurrence did not differ between the RE+ and RE- groups
(HR = 0.85 [CI 0.52-1.41]; p = 0.54), nor did DTC-specific mortality (HR = 0.54
[CI 0.21-1.37]; p = 0.20).
CONCLUSIONS: While DTC following RE has historically been considered a more
aggressive variant than DTC in the absence of RE, the present data indicate that 
RE+ DTC is associated with better OS than RE- DTC, especially for males.
Additionally, recent reports are confirmed of equivalent rates of thyroid cancer 
recurrence. These results warrant further investigation into the factors
underlying this unexpected finding.

BACKGROUND: Current quality of life assessment tools for thyroid cancer survivors
are not clinically useful due to the length of available questionnaires.
Computerized adaptive tests are easily administered electronically and can
achieve highly accurate and efficient results in minimal time. We aimed to
develop a quality of life computerized adaptive tests (ThyCAT) for thyroid cancer
survivors.
METHODS: A bifactor item response theory model was fit to questionnaire responses
from 1,078 North American Thyroid Cancer Survivorship Study participants-a
longitudinal cohort study of quality of life in thyroid cancer survivors. Tuning 
parameters were selected to maintain a correlation of r > 0.9 with the total item
bank quality of life score obtained from the original North American Thyroid
Cancer Survivorship Study questions, using a minimal number of adaptively
administered ThyCAT items.
RESULTS: The ThyCAT assesses quality of life with strong correlation (r = 0.96)
with the original 75 North American Thyroid Cancer Survivorship Study questions
using an average of 9.94 questions (SD ± 3.03) administered in <2 minutes. There 
was no statistically significant difference in the number of ThyCAT questions
required based on demographic or tumor characteristics.
CONCLUSION: The ThyCAT can be administered on a smartphone app in <10 questions, 
and <2 minutes, allowing efficient and accurate in or out of clinic
identification of patients struggling with quality of life issues after thyroid
cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid-related mortality has remained constant despite the
increasing incidence of thyroid carcinoma. Most thyroid nodules are benign;
therefore, ultrasound and fine needle aspiration (FNA) are integral in cancer
screening. We hypothesize that increased nodule size at ultrasound does not
predict malignancy and correlation between nodule size at ultrasound and
pathologic exam is good.
METHODS: Resected thyroids with preoperative ultrasounds were identified. Nodule 
size at ultrasound, FNA diagnosis by Bethesda category, size at pathologic
examination, and final histologic diagnosis were recorded. Nodule characteristics
at ultrasound and FNA diagnoses were correlated with gross characteristics and
histologic diagnoses. Nodules for which correlation could not be established were
excluded.
RESULTS: Of 1003 nodules from 659 patients, 26% were malignant. Nodules <2 cm had
the highest malignancy rate (∼30%). Risk was similar (∼20%) for nodules ≥2 cm. Of
the 548 subject to FNA, 38% were malignant. Decreasing malignancy rates were
observed with increasing size (57% for nodules <1 cm to 20% for nodules >6 cm).
At ultrasound size cutoffs of 2, 3, 4, and 5 cm, smaller nodules had higher
malignancy rates than larger nodules. Of the 455 not subject to FNA, 11% were
malignant. Ultrasound size alone is a poor predictor of malignancy, but a
relatively good predictor of final pathologic size (R2 = 0.748), with less
correlation at larger sizes. In nodules subject to FNA, false negative diagnoses 
were highest (6-8%) in nodules 3-6 cm, mostly due to encapsulated follicular
variant of papillary carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid nodule size is inversely related to malignancy risk, as
larger nodules have lower malignancy rates. However, the relationship of size to 
malignancy varies by FNA status. All nodules (regardless of FNA status)
demonstrate a risk trough at ≥2 cm. Nodules subject to FNA show step-wise decline
in malignancy rates by size, demonstrating that size alone should not be
considered as an independent risk factor. Size at ultrasound shows relatively
good correlation with final pathologic size. False negative rates are low in this
series. Lesions with the appropriate constellation of clinical and radiographic
findings should undergo FNA regardless of size. Both size and FNA diagnosis
should influence the clinical decision-making process.

BACKGROUND: Radiation is a well-described risk factor for differentiated thyroid 
carcinoma (DTC). Although the natural history of DTC following nuclear disasters 
and in healthcare workers with chronic radiation exposure (RE) has been
described, little is known about DTC following short-term exposure to therapeutic
medical radiation for benign disease. This study compares DTC morphology and
outcomes in patients with and without a prior history of therapeutic external RE.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients with DTC treated at The
University of Chicago between 1951 and 1987, with a median follow-up of 27 years 
(range 0.3-60 years). Patients were classified as either having (RE+) or not
having (RE-) a history of therapeutic RE. Variables examined included sex, age at
RE, dose of RE, indication for RE, DTC histology, and outcome. Morphology was
determined by blinded retrospective review of all available histologic slides.
Outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier
curves.
RESULTS: Of 257 DTC patients, 165 (64%) were RE- and 92 (36%) were RE+, with
males comprising a greater proportion of the RE+ group (43.5% vs. 27.3%;
p = 0.01). A total of 94.2% of DTC cases were classic papillary cancers;
histology did not differ between RE+ and RE- cohorts (p = 0.73). RE was
associated with an increased median overall survival (OS; 43 years vs. 38 years; 
hazard ratio [HR] = 0.55 [confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.89]; p = 0.01).
Survival for males in the RE- group was significantly worse than it was for RE-
females (HR = 1.78 [CI 1.05-3.03]; p = 0.03) or RE+ males (HR = 2.98 [CI
1.39-6.38]; p = 0.01). Recurrence did not differ between the RE+ and RE- groups
(HR = 0.85 [CI 0.52-1.41]; p = 0.54), nor did DTC-specific mortality (HR = 0.54
[CI 0.21-1.37]; p = 0.20).
CONCLUSIONS: While DTC following RE has historically been considered a more
aggressive variant than DTC in the absence of RE, the present data indicate that 
RE+ DTC is associated with better OS than RE- DTC, especially for males.
Additionally, recent reports are confirmed of equivalent rates of thyroid cancer 
recurrence. These results warrant further investigation into the factors
underlying this unexpected finding.

BACKGROUND: Current quality of life assessment tools for thyroid cancer survivors
are not clinically useful due to the length of available questionnaires.
Computerized adaptive tests are easily administered electronically and can
achieve highly accurate and efficient results in minimal time. We aimed to
develop a quality of life computerized adaptive tests (ThyCAT) for thyroid cancer
survivors.
METHODS: A bifactor item response theory model was fit to questionnaire responses
from 1,078 North American Thyroid Cancer Survivorship Study participants-a
longitudinal cohort study of quality of life in thyroid cancer survivors. Tuning 
parameters were selected to maintain a correlation of r > 0.9 with the total item
bank quality of life score obtained from the original North American Thyroid
Cancer Survivorship Study questions, using a minimal number of adaptively
administered ThyCAT items.
RESULTS: The ThyCAT assesses quality of life with strong correlation (r = 0.96)
with the original 75 North American Thyroid Cancer Survivorship Study questions
using an average of 9.94 questions (SD ± 3.03) administered in <2 minutes. There 
was no statistically significant difference in the number of ThyCAT questions
required based on demographic or tumor characteristics.
CONCLUSION: The ThyCAT can be administered on a smartphone app in <10 questions, 
and <2 minutes, allowing efficient and accurate in or out of clinic
identification of patients struggling with quality of life issues after thyroid
cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid-related mortality has remained constant despite the
increasing incidence of thyroid carcinoma. Most thyroid nodules are benign;
therefore, ultrasound and fine needle aspiration (FNA) are integral in cancer
screening. We hypothesize that increased nodule size at ultrasound does not
predict malignancy and correlation between nodule size at ultrasound and
pathologic exam is good.
METHODS: Resected thyroids with preoperative ultrasounds were identified. Nodule 
size at ultrasound, FNA diagnosis by Bethesda category, size at pathologic
examination, and final histologic diagnosis were recorded. Nodule characteristics
at ultrasound and FNA diagnoses were correlated with gross characteristics and
histologic diagnoses. Nodules for which correlation could not be established were
excluded.
RESULTS: Of 1003 nodules from 659 patients, 26% were malignant. Nodules <2 cm had
the highest malignancy rate (∼30%). Risk was similar (∼20%) for nodules ≥2 cm. Of
the 548 subject to FNA, 38% were malignant. Decreasing malignancy rates were
observed with increasing size (57% for nodules <1 cm to 20% for nodules >6 cm).
At ultrasound size cutoffs of 2, 3, 4, and 5 cm, smaller nodules had higher
malignancy rates than larger nodules. Of the 455 not subject to FNA, 11% were
malignant. Ultrasound size alone is a poor predictor of malignancy, but a
relatively good predictor of final pathologic size (R2 = 0.748), with less
correlation at larger sizes. In nodules subject to FNA, false negative diagnoses 
were highest (6-8%) in nodules 3-6 cm, mostly due to encapsulated follicular
variant of papillary carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid nodule size is inversely related to malignancy risk, as
larger nodules have lower malignancy rates. However, the relationship of size to 
malignancy varies by FNA status. All nodules (regardless of FNA status)
demonstrate a risk trough at ≥2 cm. Nodules subject to FNA show step-wise decline
in malignancy rates by size, demonstrating that size alone should not be
considered as an independent risk factor. Size at ultrasound shows relatively
good correlation with final pathologic size. False negative rates are low in this
series. Lesions with the appropriate constellation of clinical and radiographic
findings should undergo FNA regardless of size. Both size and FNA diagnosis
should influence the clinical decision-making process.

    Surgery. 2017 Jan;161(1):67-69.

BACKGROUND: Normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism presents diagnostic and
intraoperative challenges, and current literature is conflicting about
management. We aim to better define normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism in 
order to improve the care for these patients.
METHODS: In the study, 516 consecutive patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for 
primary hyperparathyroidism were divided into 2 groups: classic primary
hyperparathyroidism (classic primary hyperparathyroidism, increased serum levels 
of calcium, and parathyroid hormone) and normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia, normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone). 
We evaluated inter-group differences in presentation, gland weight, pathology,
and complications.
RESULTS: The normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism group was comprised of 116
(22.5%) patients. Mean serum levels of parathyroid hormone and calcium were 62.1 
pg/mL ± 10.1 and 10.6 mg/dL ± 0.63 in normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism, 
and 142 ± 89.0pg/mL and 11.0 ± 0.88 (both P < .01) for classic primary
hyperparathyroidism. Nephrolithiasis was more common in normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism. Multigland hyperplasia was more common in
normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism 23 (19.8%) vs 44 (11%; P = .04).
Concordant imaging studies were less likely in normohormonal primary
hyperparathyroidism (82 [73.2%] vs 337 [87.1%; P < .01]), had a lesser total
gland weight (531.8 mg ± 680.0 vs 1,039.6 mg ± 1,237.3; P < .01), and lesser
2-week parathyroid hormone (32.5 pg/mL ± 18.95 vs 41.0 pg/mL ± 27.8; P = .01).
There was no difference in hypoparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone <15 pg/mL;
P = .93) at 2 weeks postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism represents 22.5% of our
primary hyperparathyroidism population, which is greater than reported
previously. It is a distinct disease process from classic primary
hyperparathyroidism in presentation, imaging, and operative findings. More
hyperplasia and a lesser gland weight make it challenging to resect the ideal
amount of tissue. Studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine
optimal operative management.

Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm with some
morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence of epithelial differentiation. The
""classic"" subtype occurs in younger patients, often in distal extremities as
compared with the ""proximal"" type. Tumors of the proximal type primarily arising 
in solid organs are rare with only few case reports in the literature. We report 
2 cases of primary ES in the kidney of a 27-year-old woman and the adrenal gland 
of a 73-year-old man. Clinical examination and imaging, including computed
tomography and positron-emission tomography, did not reveal tumor elsewhere in
both cases. Histologic features were those of ES, proximal type with
epithelioid/rhabdoid phenotype. Immunohistochemical study in both cases showed
strong, diffuse expression of epithelial markers, CD34, and CD31. Nuclear
expression of SMARCB1 protein was lost, but fluorescence in situ hybridization
analysis was negative for SMARCB1 deletion. We believe that these are the first
reports of primary kidney and adrenal gland ES.

BACKGROUND: With over 110,000 bariatric operations performed in the United States
annually, it is important to understand the biochemical abnormalities causing
endocrine dysfunction associated with these procedures. Here we compare 2
malabsorptive procedures, duodenal switch and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, to
determine the role malabsorption plays in secondary hyperparathyroidism in this
population.
METHODS: Data from all super-obese patients undergoing duodenal switch or
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between August 2002 and October 2005 were prospectively 
collected. Postoperatively, all patients received 1,200 mg of calcium citrate and
1,000 IU vitamin D3 per American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery
guidelines. Beginning in 2007, duodenal switch patients were instructed to add
daily vitamin D3 10,000 IU. Statistical analyses included Student t test,
multivariate, and univariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 283 patients with a body mass index ≥50, 170 (60.1%) underwent
duodenal switch, while 113 (39.9%) underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Of 132
(46.6%) patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, 101 (59.4%) had undergone
duodenal switch and 31 (27.4%) had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Symptoms
were more common in the duodenal switch group (33 patients [19.4%]) than
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (11 patients [9.7%]). Multivariate logistic regression
demonstrated that the extent of bypass and duration of follow-up were the only 2 
independent predictive risk factors for developing secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Although vitamin D levels improved with increased vitamin D3 supplementation in
2007, rates of secondary hyperparathyroidism increased.
CONCLUSION: Despite routine postoperative calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation,
secondary hyperparathyroidism is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and
duodenal switch. The degree of iatrogenic malabsorption correlates with the
incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism. These rates suggest current
supplementation guidelines are not sufficient in preventing secondary
hyperparathyroidism. Further work is needed to better define the sequelae of
long-term hyperparathyroidism.

Zinc Deficiency is Associated with Poor Clinical Outcomes in Patients with
Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

Disease Center, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, Illinois; and
†Department of Health Studies, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.

BACKGROUND: Zinc plays a pivotal role in wound repair, tissue regeneration, and
the immune response. Although zinc deficiency is common in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the impact of low serum zinc levels on disease 
course is not known.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in a prospectively collected IBD registry with at
least 2 serum zinc measurements were included in the analysis. Using a logistic
regression model, rates of IBD-related surgeries, IBD-related hospitalizations,
and IBD-related complications were evaluated after a diagnosis of zinc deficiency
(serum concentration <0.66 μg/mL) compared with those with normal zinc
concentrations. In patients who were zinc deficient, outcomes were also analyzed 
between those who had normalization of zinc levels within 12 months and those who
remained deficient.
RESULTS: A total of 773 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 223 with
ulcerative colitis (UC) were included in the analysis. After adjusting for
covariates, zinc deficiency was associated with an increased risk of subsequent
hospitalizations, surgeries, and disease-related complications in patients with
CD and UC (CD: hospitalizations, odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval
[1.02-2.04]; surgeries, 2.05 [1.38-3.05]; complications, 1.50 [1.04-2.15]; UC:
hospitalizations, 2.14 [1.07-4.29]; surgeries, 1.64 [0.59-4.52]; complications,
1.97 [0.94-4.11]). Normalization of zinc was associated with improvement in these
outcomes in patients with both CD and UC.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD with serum zinc deficiency are more likely to have
adverse disease-specific outcomes. As these outcomes improve with normalization
of zinc, the results from this study support the role for close monitoring and
replacement of zinc in patients with IBD.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays pathogenic roles in renal and
cardiovascular disorders, but whether it is involved in colitis is unclear. Here 
we show that RenTgMK mice that overexpress active renin from the liver developed 
more severe colitis than wild-type controls. More than 50% RenTgMK mice died
whereas all wild-type mice recovered. RenTgMK mice exhibited more robust mucosal 
TH17 and TH1/TH17 responses and more profound colonic epithelial cell apoptosis
compared to wild-type controls. Treatment with aliskiren (a renin inhibitor), but
not hydralazine (a smooth muscle relaxant), ameliorated colitis in RenTgMK mice, 
although both drugs normalized blood pressure. Chronic infusion of angiotensin II
into wild-type mice mimicked the severe colitic phenotype of RenTgMK mice, and

BACKGROUND: Zinc plays a pivotal role in wound repair, tissue regeneration, and
the immune response. Although zinc deficiency is common in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the impact of low serum zinc levels on disease 
course is not known.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in a prospectively collected IBD registry with at
least 2 serum zinc measurements were included in the analysis. Using a logistic
regression model, rates of IBD-related surgeries, IBD-related hospitalizations,
and IBD-related complications were evaluated after a diagnosis of zinc deficiency
(serum concentration <0.66 μg/mL) compared with those with normal zinc
concentrations. In patients who were zinc deficient, outcomes were also analyzed 
between those who had normalization of zinc levels within 12 months and those who
remained deficient.
RESULTS: A total of 773 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 223 with
ulcerative colitis (UC) were included in the analysis. After adjusting for
covariates, zinc deficiency was associated with an increased risk of subsequent
hospitalizations, surgeries, and disease-related complications in patients with
CD and UC (CD: hospitalizations, odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval
[1.02-2.04]; surgeries, 2.05 [1.38-3.05]; complications, 1.50 [1.04-2.15]; UC:
hospitalizations, 2.14 [1.07-4.29]; surgeries, 1.64 [0.59-4.52]; complications,
1.97 [0.94-4.11]). Normalization of zinc was associated with improvement in these
outcomes in patients with both CD and UC.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD with serum zinc deficiency are more likely to have
adverse disease-specific outcomes. As these outcomes improve with normalization
of zinc, the results from this study support the role for close monitoring and
replacement of zinc in patients with IBD.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays pathogenic roles in renal and
cardiovascular disorders, but whether it is involved in colitis is unclear. Here 
we show that RenTgMK mice that overexpress active renin from the liver developed 
more severe colitis than wild-type controls. More than 50% RenTgMK mice died
whereas all wild-type mice recovered. RenTgMK mice exhibited more robust mucosal 
TH17 and TH1/TH17 responses and more profound colonic epithelial cell apoptosis
compared to wild-type controls. Treatment with aliskiren (a renin inhibitor), but
not hydralazine (a smooth muscle relaxant), ameliorated colitis in RenTgMK mice, 
although both drugs normalized blood pressure. Chronic infusion of angiotensin II
into wild-type mice mimicked the severe colitic phenotype of RenTgMK mice, and
treatment with losartan [an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB)]
ameliorated colitis in wild-type mice, confirming a colitogenic role for the

PURPOSE: International consensus (IC) clinical target volumes (CTVs) have been
proposed to standardize radiation field design in the treatment of patients at
high risk of locoregional failure (LRF) after radical cystectomy. The purpose of 
this study was to externally validate the IC CTVs in a cohort of postsurgical
patients followed up for LRF and identify revisions that might improve the IC
CTVs' performance.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Among 334 patients with pT3 to pT4 bladder cancer treated 
with radical cystectomy, LRF developed in 58 (17%), of whom 52 had computed
tomography scans available for review. Images with LRF were exported into a
treatment planning system, and IC CTVs were contoured and evaluated for adequacy 
of coverage of each LRF with respect to both the patient and each of 6 pelvic
subsites: common iliac (CI) region, obturator region (OR), external and internal 
iliac region, presacral region, cystectomy bed, or other pelvic site. Revisions
to the IC contours were proposed based on the findings.
RESULTS: Of the 52 patients with documented LRF, 13 (25%) had LRFs that were
outside of the IC CTV involving 17 pelvic subsites: 5 near the CI CTV, 5 near the
OR CTV, 1 near the external and internal iliac region, and 6 near the cystectomy 
bed. The 5 CI failures were located superior to the CTV, and the 5 OR failures
were located medial to the CTV. Increasing the superior boundary of the CI to a
vessel-based definition of the aortic bifurcation, as well as increasing the
medial extension of the OR by an additional 9 mm, decreased the number of
patients with LRF outside of the IC CTV to 7 (13%).
CONCLUSIONS: Modified IC CTVs inclusive of a slight adjustment superiorly for the
CI region and medially for the OR may reduce the risk of pelvic failure in
patients treated with adjuvant radiation therapy.

PURPOSE: Pelvic bone marrow (BM) constraints may offer a means to reduce the
toxicity commonly associated with chemoradiation for anal cancer. We conducted a 
bi-institutional analysis of dose-volume metrics in a time-sensitive fashion to
devise practical metrics to minimize hematologic toxicity.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-six anal cancer patients from 2 institutions
received definitive radiation therapy (median primary dose of 54 Gy) using
intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT, n=49) or 3-dimensional (3D)
conformal therapy (n=7) with concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C.
Weekly blood counts were retrospectively plotted to characterize the time course 
of cytopenias. Dose-volume parameters were correlated with blood counts at a
standardized time point to identify predictors of initial blood count nadirs.
RESULTS: Leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets reached a nadir at week 3 of
treatment. Smaller volumes of the pelvic BM correlated most strongly with lower
week 3 blood counts, more so than age, sex, body mass index (BMI), or dose
metrics. Patients who had ≥750 cc of pelvic BM spared from doses of ≥30 Gy had 0%
grade 3+ leukopenia or neutropenia at week 3. Higher V40 Gy to the lower pelvic
BM (LP V40) also correlated with cytopenia. Patients with an LP V40 >23% had
higher rates of grade 3+ leukopenia (29% vs 4%, P=.02), grade 3+ neutropenia (33%
vs 8%, P=.04), and grade 2+ thrombocytopenia (32% vs 7%, P=.04) at week 3. On
multivariate analysis, pelvic BM volume and LP V40 remained associated with
leukocyte count, and all marrow subsite volumes remained associated with
neutrophil counts at week 3 (P<.1).
CONCLUSIONS: Larger pelvic BM volumes correlate with less severe leukocyte and
neutrophil nadirs, suggesting that larger total ""marrow reserve"" can mitigate
cytopenias. Sparing a critical marrow reserve and limiting the V40 Gy to the
lower pelvis may reduce the risk of hematologic toxicity.

PURPOSE: To determine whether a dose-response relationship exists for salvage
radiation therapy (RT) of biochemical failure after prostatectomy for prostate
cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Individual data from 1108 patients who underwent salvage
RT at 10 academic centers were pooled. The cohort was enriched for selection
criteria more likely associated with tumor recurrence in the prostate bed (margin
positive and pre-RT prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level of ≤2.0 ng/mL) and
without the confounding of planned androgen suppression. The cumulative incidence
of biochemical failure and distant metastasis over time was computed, and
competing risks hazard regression models were used to investigate the association
between potential predictors and these outcomes. The association of radiation
dose with outcomes was the primary focus.
RESULTS: With a 65.2-month follow-up duration, the 5- and 10-year estimates of
freedom from post-RT biochemical failure (PSA level >0.2 ng/mL and rising) was
63.5% and 49.8%, respectively, and the cumulative incidence of distant metastasis
was 12.4% by 10 years. A Gleason score of ≥7, higher pre-RT PSA level,
extraprostatic tumor extension, and seminal vesicle invasion were associated with
worse biochemical failure and distant metastasis outcomes. A salvage radiation
dose of ≥66.0 Gy was associated with a reduced cumulative incidence of
biochemical failure, but not of distant metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of salvage radiation doses of ≥66.0 Gy are supported by
evidence presented in the present multicenter pooled analysis of individual
patient data. The observational reporting method, limited sample size, few
distant metastasis events, modest follow-up duration, and elective use of salvage
therapy might have diminished the opportunity to identify an association between

PURPOSE: To report the results of endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging
(eMRI) in patients with localized prostate cancer, and how these images
influenced radiotherapeutic management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 122 men with localized adenocarcinoma of the
prostate referred to radiation oncology underwent 3-T eMRI between 2010 and 2014,
to evaluate candidacy for active surveillance (n = 26) and brachytherapy as
monotherapy (n = 47), or to further risk stratify intermediate-risk (n = 29) or
high-risk (n = 20) men before external beam radiation therapy. By National
Comprehensive Cancer Network classification, men had low-risk (28%),
intermediate-risk (55%), or high-risk (17%) disease. Multiparametric MRI
sequences included T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic
contrast-enhanced imaging. Radiographic extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle 
invasion (rSVI), and pelvic lymph node involvement (LNI) were graded as negative,
indeterminate, or positive. A dominant nodule was defined as a nodule≥1.5cm.
Changes in management were identified comparing pre-MRI and post-MRI plan of
care.
RESULTS: The rates of radiographic extracapsular extension, radiographic seminal 
vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, and dominant nodule were 39%, 7%, 12%, 
and 28%, respectively. The eMRI identified measurable disease in most patients
with an increasing burden of disease (sextants involved, median nodule size)
according to risk category (P<0.01). Changes in management after eMRI occurred in
18%, including 9%, 18%, and 33% of men with low-risk, intermediate-risk, or
high-risk disease (P = 0.08), and 12%, 17%, and 22% of men who were candidates
for active surveillance, brachytherapy as monotherapy, or external beam radiation
therapy (P = 0.48), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The eMRI influenced management in a risk-dependent fashion. Further
study is required to determine the clinical importance of eMRI findings and to
determine whether changes in management can lead to improved clinical outcome.

PURPOSE: International consensus (IC) clinical target volumes (CTVs) have been
proposed to standardize radiation field design in the treatment of patients at
high risk of locoregional failure (LRF) after radical cystectomy. The purpose of 
this study was to externally validate the IC CTVs in a cohort of postsurgical
patients followed up for LRF and identify revisions that might improve the IC
CTVs' performance.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Among 334 patients with pT3 to pT4 bladder cancer treated 
with radical cystectomy, LRF developed in 58 (17%), of whom 52 had computed
tomography scans available for review. Images with LRF were exported into a
treatment planning system, and IC CTVs were contoured and evaluated for adequacy 
of coverage of each LRF with respect to both the patient and each of 6 pelvic
subsites: common iliac (CI) region, obturator region (OR), external and internal 
iliac region, presacral region, cystectomy bed, or other pelvic site. Revisions
to the IC contours were proposed based on the findings.
RESULTS: Of the 52 patients with documented LRF, 13 (25%) had LRFs that were
outside of the IC CTV involving 17 pelvic subsites: 5 near the CI CTV, 5 near the
OR CTV, 1 near the external and internal iliac region, and 6 near the cystectomy 
bed. The 5 CI failures were located superior to the CTV, and the 5 OR failures
were located medial to the CTV. Increasing the superior boundary of the CI to a
vessel-based definition of the aortic bifurcation, as well as increasing the
medial extension of the OR by an additional 9 mm, decreased the number of
patients with LRF outside of the IC CTV to 7 (13%).
CONCLUSIONS: Modified IC CTVs inclusive of a slight adjustment superiorly for the
CI region and medially for the OR may reduce the risk of pelvic failure in
patients treated with adjuvant radiation therapy.

PURPOSE: Pelvic bone marrow (BM) constraints may offer a means to reduce the
toxicity commonly associated with chemoradiation for anal cancer. We conducted a 
bi-institutional analysis of dose-volume metrics in a time-sensitive fashion to
devise practical metrics to minimize hematologic toxicity.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-six anal cancer patients from 2 institutions
received definitive radiation therapy (median primary dose of 54 Gy) using
intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT, n=49) or 3-dimensional (3D)
conformal therapy (n=7) with concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C.
Weekly blood counts were retrospectively plotted to characterize the time course 
of cytopenias. Dose-volume parameters were correlated with blood counts at a
standardized time point to identify predictors of initial blood count nadirs.
RESULTS: Leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets reached a nadir at week 3 of
treatment. Smaller volumes of the pelvic BM correlated most strongly with lower
week 3 blood counts, more so than age, sex, body mass index (BMI), or dose
metrics. Patients who had ≥750 cc of pelvic BM spared from doses of ≥30 Gy had 0%
grade 3+ leukopenia or neutropenia at week 3. Higher V40 Gy to the lower pelvic
BM (LP V40) also correlated with cytopenia. Patients with an LP V40 >23% had
higher rates of grade 3+ leukopenia (29% vs 4%, P=.02), grade 3+ neutropenia (33%
vs 8%, P=.04), and grade 2+ thrombocytopenia (32% vs 7%, P=.04) at week 3. On
multivariate analysis, pelvic BM volume and LP V40 remained associated with
leukocyte count, and all marrow subsite volumes remained associated with
neutrophil counts at week 3 (P<.1).
CONCLUSIONS: Larger pelvic BM volumes correlate with less severe leukocyte and
neutrophil nadirs, suggesting that larger total ""marrow reserve"" can mitigate
cytopenias. Sparing a critical marrow reserve and limiting the V40 Gy to the
lower pelvis may reduce the risk of hematologic toxicity.

PURPOSE: To determine whether a dose-response relationship exists for salvage
radiation therapy (RT) of biochemical failure after prostatectomy for prostate
cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Individual data from 1108 patients who underwent salvage
RT at 10 academic centers were pooled. The cohort was enriched for selection
criteria more likely associated with tumor recurrence in the prostate bed (margin
positive and pre-RT prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level of ≤2.0 ng/mL) and
without the confounding of planned androgen suppression. The cumulative incidence
of biochemical failure and distant metastasis over time was computed, and
competing risks hazard regression models were used to investigate the association
between potential predictors and these outcomes. The association of radiation
dose with outcomes was the primary focus.
RESULTS: With a 65.2-month follow-up duration, the 5- and 10-year estimates of
freedom from post-RT biochemical failure (PSA level >0.2 ng/mL and rising) was
63.5% and 49.8%, respectively, and the cumulative incidence of distant metastasis
was 12.4% by 10 years. A Gleason score of ≥7, higher pre-RT PSA level,
extraprostatic tumor extension, and seminal vesicle invasion were associated with
worse biochemical failure and distant metastasis outcomes. A salvage radiation
dose of ≥66.0 Gy was associated with a reduced cumulative incidence of
biochemical failure, but not of distant metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of salvage radiation doses of ≥66.0 Gy are supported by
evidence presented in the present multicenter pooled analysis of individual
patient data. The observational reporting method, limited sample size, few
distant metastasis events, modest follow-up duration, and elective use of salvage
therapy might have diminished the opportunity to identify an association between 
the radiation dose and this endpoint.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are associated with subclinical changes
in cardiac function. Although the mechanism underlying this finding is unknown,
elevated levels of soluble antiangiogenic proteins such as soluble fms-like
tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1) and soluble endoglin (sEng) are associated with
myocardial dysfunction and may play a role. We hypothesized that these
antiangiogenic proteins may contribute to the development of cardiac dysfunction 
in HDP. We prospectively studied 207 pregnant women with HDP and nonhypertensive 
controls and evaluated whether changes in global longitudinal strain (GLS)
observed on echocardiography is specific for HDP and whether these changes
correlate with HDP biomarkers, sFlt1 and sEng. A total of 62 (30%) patients were 
diagnosed with preeclampsia (group A), 105 (51%) did not have an HDP (group B),
and 40 (19%) were diagnosed with chronic or gestational hypertension (group C).
Blood was drawn and sFlt1 and sEng levels measured using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. Comprehensive echocardiograms, including measurement of GLS,
were performed on all patients. Overall, GLS was worse in women in group A
(preeclampsia) than those in group B or C. Increasing sFlt1 and sEng levels
correlated with worsening GLS (r=0.44 for sFlt1 and r=0.46 for sEng, both
P<0.001), which remained significant after multivariable analysis (r=0.18 and
r=0.22, both P≤0.01). Increasing levels also correlated with increasing left
ventricular mass index, which also remained significant after multivariable
analysis (r=0.20 for sFlt1 and 0.19 for sEng, both P=0.01). Elevated circulating 
levels of antiangiogenic proteins in HDP correlate with and may contribute to
myocardial dysfunction as measured by GLS.

Recent studies show that colonic vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling protects the 
mucosal epithelial barrier and suppresses colonic inflammation, but the
underlying molecular mechanism remains to be fully understood. To investigate the
implication of colonic VDR downregulation seen in patients with inflammatory
bowel disease, we assessed the effect of gut epithelial VDR deletion on colonic
inflammatory responses in an experimental colitis model. In a
2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis model, mice carrying VDR
deletion in gut epithelial cells [VDRflox/flox (VDRf/f);Villin-Cre or VDRΔIEC] or
in colonic epithelial cells (VDRf/f;CDX2-Cre or VDRΔCEC) developed more severe
clinical colitis than VDRf/f control mice, characterized by more robust T-helper 
(TH)1 and TH17 responses, with greater increases in mucosal interferon (IFN)-γ+, 
interleukin (IL)-17+, and IFN-γ+IL-17+ T cells. Accompanying the severe mucosal
inflammation was more profound colonic epithelial cell apoptosis in the mutant
mice. Treatment with caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh dramatically reduced colitis
severity and attenuated TH1 and TH17 responses in VDRΔCEC mice. The blockade of
cell apoptosis also prevented the increase in mucosal CD11b+CD103+ dendritic
cells (DCs), known to be critical for TH17-cell activation. Moreover, depletion
of gut commensal bacteria with antibiotics eliminated the robust TH1 and TH17
responses and CD11b+CD103+ DC induction. Taken together, these observations
demonstrate that gut epithelial VDR deletion aggravates epithelial cell
apoptosis, resulting in increases in mucosal barrier permeability. Consequently, 
invading luminal bacteria activate CD11b+CD103+ DCs, which promote mucosal TH1
and TH17 responses. Therefore, gut epithelial VDR signaling controls mucosal
inflammation by suppressing epithelial cell apoptosis.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays pathogenic roles in renal and
cardiovascular disorders, but whether it is involved in colitis is unclear. Here 
we show that RenTgMK mice that overexpress active renin from the liver developed 
more severe colitis than wild-type controls. More than 50% RenTgMK mice died
whereas all wild-type mice recovered. RenTgMK mice exhibited more robust mucosal 
TH17 and TH1/TH17 responses and more profound colonic epithelial cell apoptosis
compared to wild-type controls. Treatment with aliskiren (a renin inhibitor), but
not hydralazine (a smooth muscle relaxant), ameliorated colitis in RenTgMK mice, 
although both drugs normalized blood pressure. Chronic infusion of angiotensin II
into wild-type mice mimicked the severe colitic phenotype of RenTgMK mice, and
treatment with losartan [an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB)]
ameliorated colitis in wild-type mice, confirming a colitogenic role for the
endogenous RAS. In human biopsies, pro-inflammatory cytokines were suppressed in 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were on ARB therapy compared to
patients not receiving ARB therapy. These observations demonstrate that
activation of the RAS promotes colitis in a blood pressure independent manner.
Angiotensin II appears to drive colonic mucosal inflammation by promoting
intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis and mucosal TH17 responses in colitis
development.

Salmonella infection in humans can become chronic, which leads to low-grade
persistent inflammation. These chronic infections increase the risk of several
gastrointestinal diseases, including cancer. Salmonella AvrA is a multifunctional
protein that influences eukaryotic cell pathways by regulating ubiquitination and
acetylation. In an animal model, we have demonstrated that infection with
AvrA-expressing Salmonella induces beta-catenin signals and enhances colonic
tumorigenesis. Beta-catenin signaling is a key player in intestinal proliferation
and tumorigenesis. The relative contributions of AvrA-induced proliferation and
inflammation on tumorigenesis, however, are unknown. STAT3 is activated in
chronically inflamed intestines in human inflammatory bowel diseases and in
colitis-associated colon cancer. In the current study, mice were colonized with
Salmonella AvrA-sufficient or AvrA-deficient bacterial strains. Then,
inflammation-associated colon cancer was induced through the use of
azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium. We determined that AvrA-expressing bacteria 
activated the STAT3 pathway, which is predicted to enhance proliferation and
promote tumorigenesis. Transcriptional activity of STAT3 and its target genes
were upregulated by Salmonella expressing AvrA, thus promoting proliferation and 
intestinal tumorigenesis. Our findings provide new insights regarding a
STAT3-dependent mechanism by which the specific bacterial product AvrA enhances
the development of infection-associated colon cancer. These insights might
suggest future biomarkers to risk assessment and early detection of
infection-related cancer.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) develops from colonic epithelial cells that lose
expression of key tumor suppressor genes and/or gain expression of
proproliferative and antiapoptotic genes like heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Heat
shock protein 70 is overexpressed in CRC, but it is not known whether this is in 
response to the proteotoxic stress induced by transformation, or if it
contributes to the process of transformation itself. Here, using the Apc (Min/+) 
mouse model of CRC, we show that Hsp70 regulates mitogenic signaling in
intestinal epithelial cells through stabilization of proteins involved in the
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and WNT signaling pathways. Loss of Hsp70 reduced 
tumor size with decreased proliferation and increased tumor cell death. Hsp70
loss also led to decreased expression of ErbB2, Akt, ERK and β-catenin along with
decreased β-catenin transcriptional activity as measured by c-myc and axin2
expression. Upregulation of RTK or WNT signals are frequent oncogenic events in
CRC and many other cancers. Thus, in addition to the role of Hsp70 in
cell-survival after transformation, Hsp70 stabilization of β-catenin, Akt, ERK
and ErbB2 are predicted to contribute to transformation. This has important
implications not only for understanding the pathophysiology of these cancers, but
also for treatment since anti-EGFR antibodies are in clinical use for CRC and
EGFR is a major ErbB2 heterodimeric partner. Targeting Hsp70, therefore, might
provide an alternative or complementary strategy for achieving better outcomes
for CRC and other related cancer types.

Recent studies show that colonic vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling protects the 
mucosal epithelial barrier and suppresses colonic inflammation, but the
underlying molecular mechanism remains to be fully understood. To investigate the
implication of colonic VDR downregulation seen in patients with inflammatory
bowel disease, we assessed the effect of gut epithelial VDR deletion on colonic
inflammatory responses in an experimental colitis model. In a
2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis model, mice carrying VDR
deletion in gut epithelial cells [VDRflox/flox (VDRf/f);Villin-Cre or VDRΔIEC] or
in colonic epithelial cells (VDRf/f;CDX2-Cre or VDRΔCEC) developed more severe
clinical colitis than VDRf/f control mice, characterized by more robust T-helper 
(TH)1 and TH17 responses, with greater increases in mucosal interferon (IFN)-γ+, 
interleukin (IL)-17+, and IFN-γ+IL-17+ T cells. Accompanying the severe mucosal
inflammation was more profound colonic epithelial cell apoptosis in the mutant
mice. Treatment with caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh dramatically reduced colitis
severity and attenuated TH1 and TH17 responses in VDRΔCEC mice. The blockade of
cell apoptosis also prevented the increase in mucosal CD11b+CD103+ dendritic
cells (DCs), known to be critical for TH17-cell activation. Moreover, depletion
of gut commensal bacteria with antibiotics eliminated the robust TH1 and TH17
responses and CD11b+CD103+ DC induction. Taken together, these observations
demonstrate that gut epithelial VDR deletion aggravates epithelial cell
apoptosis, resulting in increases in mucosal barrier permeability. Consequently, 
invading luminal bacteria activate CD11b+CD103+ DCs, which promote mucosal TH1
and TH17 responses. Therefore, gut epithelial VDR signaling controls mucosal
inflammation by suppressing epithelial cell apoptosis.

BACKGROUND: The presence of population structure in a sample may confound the
search for important genetic loci associated with disease. Our four samples in
the Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND), European Americans, 
Mexican Americans, African Americans, and American Indians are part of a genome- 
wide association study in which population structure might be particularly
important. We therefore decided to study in detail one component of this,
individual genetic ancestry (IGA). From SNPs present on the Affymetrix 6.0 Human 
SNP array, we identified 3 sets of ancestry informative markers (AIMs), each
maximized for the information in one the three contrasts among ancestral
populations: Europeans (HAPMAP, CEU), Africans (HAPMAP, YRI and LWK), and Native 
Americans (full heritage Pima Indians). We estimate IGA and present an algorithm 
for their standard errors, compare IGA to principal components, emphasize the
importance of balancing information in the ancestry informative markers (AIMs),
and test the association of IGA with diabetic nephropathy in the combined sample.
RESULTS: A fixed parental allele maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to the 
FIND to estimate IGA in four samples: 869 American Indians; 1385 African
Americans; 1451 Mexican Americans; and 826 European Americans. When the
information in the AIMs is unbalanced, the estimates are incorrect with large
error. Individual genetic admixture is highly correlated with principle
components for capturing population structure. It takes ~700 SNPs to reduce the
average standard error of individual admixture below 0.01. When the samples are
combined, the resulting population structure creates associations between IGA and
diabetic nephropathy.
CONCLUSIONS: The identified set of AIMs, which include American Indian parental
allele frequencies, may be particularly useful for estimating genetic admixture
in populations from the Americas. Failure to balance information in maximum
likelihood, poly-ancestry models creates biased estimates of individual admixture
with large error. This also occurs when estimating IGA using the Bayesian
clustering method as implemented in the program STRUCTURE. Odds ratios for the
associations of IGA with disease are consistent with what is known about the
incidence and prevalence of diabetic nephropathy in these populations.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to test the feasibility and accuracy of an
automated algorithm that simultaneously quantifies 3-dimensional (3D)
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)-derived left atrial (LA) and left
ventricular (LV) volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
Conventional manual 3D TTE tracings and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images
were used as a reference for comparison.
BACKGROUND: Cardiac chamber quantification from 3D TTE is superior to 2D TTE
measurements. However, integration of 3D quantification into clinical practice
has been limited by time-consuming workflow and the need for 3D expertise. A
novel automated software was developed that provides LV and LA volumetric
quantification from 3D TTE datasets that reflect real-life manual 3-dimensional
echocardiography measurements and values comparable to CMR.
METHODS: A total of 159 patients were studied in 2 separate protocols. In
protocol 1, 94 patients underwent 3D TTE imaging (EPIQ, iE33, X5-1, Philips
Healthcare, Andover, Massachusetts) covering the left atrium and left ventricle. 
LA and LV volumes and LVEF were obtained using the automated software
(HeartModel, Philips Healthcare) with and without contour correction, and
compared with the averaged manual 3D volumetric measurements from 3 readers. In
protocol 2, automated measurements from 65 patients were compared with a CMR
reference. The Pearson correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analysis, and paired
Student t tests were used to assess inter-technique agreement.
RESULTS: Correlations between the automated and manual 3D TTE measurements were
strong (r = 0.87 to 0.96). LVEF was underestimated and automated LV
end-diastolic, LV end-systolic, and LA volumes were overestimated compared with
manual measurements. Agreement between the automated analysis and CMR was also
strong (r = 0.84 to 0.95). Test-retest variability was low.
CONCLUSIONS: Automated simultaneous quantification of LA and LV volumes and LVEF 
is feasible and requires minimal 3D software analysis training. The automated
measurements are not only comparable to manual measurements but also to CMR. This
technique is highly reproducible and timesaving, and it therefore promises to
facilitate the integration of 3D TTE-based left-heart chamber quantification into
clinical practice.

Patients with a limited number of hepatic metastases and slow rates of
progression can be successfully treated with local treatment approaches1,2.
However, little is known about the heterogeneity of liver metastases, and animal 
models capable of evaluating the development of individual metastatic colonies
are needed. Here, we present an advanced model of hepatic metastases that
provides the ability to quantitatively visualize the development of individual
tumor clones in the liver and estimate their growth kinetics and colonization
efficiency. We generated a panel of monoclonal derivatives of HCT116 human
colorectal cancer cells stably labeled with luciferase and tdTomato and
possessing different growth properties. With a splenic injection followed by a
splenectomy, the majority of these clones are able to generate hepatic
metastases, but with different frequencies of colonization and varying growth
rates. Using the In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS), it is possible to visualize and
quantify metastasis development with in vivo luminescent and ex vivo fluorescent 
imaging. In addition, Diffuse Luminescent Imaging Tomography (DLIT) provides a 3D
distribution of liver metastases in vivo. Ex vivo fluorescent imaging of
harvested livers provides quantitative measurements of individual hepatic
metastatic colonies, allowing for the evaluation of the frequency of liver
colonization and the growth kinetics of metastases. Since the model is similar to
clinically observed liver metastases, it can serve as a modality for detecting
genes associated with liver metastasis and for testing potential ablative or
adjuvant treatments for liver metastatic disease.

BACKGROUND: The selection of patients for oligometastasis-directed ablative
therapy remains a challenge. The authors report on clinical and molecular
predictors of survival from a stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
dose-escalation trial for oligometastases.
METHODS: Patients who had from 1 to 5 metastases, a life expectancy of >3 months,
and a Karnofsky performance status of >60 received escalating SBRT doses to all
known cancer sites. Time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall
survival (OS) were calculated at the completion of SBRT, and clinical predictors 
of OS were modeled. Primary tumor microRNA expression was analyzed to identify
molecular predictors of OS.
RESULTS: Sixty-one evaluable patients were enrolled from 2004 to 2009. The median
follow-up was 2.3 years for all patients (range, 0.2-9.3 years) and 6.8 years for
survivors (range, 2.0-9.3 years). The median, 2-year, and 5-year estimated OS
were 2.4 years, 57%, and 32%, respectively. The rate of progression after SBRT
was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.24-1.82). The time from initial cancer diagnosis to
metastasis (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99), the time from metastasis to SBRT (HR,
0.98; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99), and breast cancer histology (HR, 0.12; 95% CI,
0.07-0.37) were significant predictors of OS. In an exploratory analysis, a
candidate classifier using expression levels of 3 microRNAs (miR-23b, miR-449a,
and miR-449b) predicted survival among 17 patients who had primary tumor microRNA
expression data available.
CONCLUSIONS: A subset of oligometastatic patients achieves long-term survival
after metastasis-directed SBRT. Clinical features and primary tumor microRNA
expression profiling, if validated in an independent dataset, may help select
oligometastatic patients most likely to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy.

The development of therapeutic antibodies represents a revolutionary change in
medical therapy for digestive diseases. Beginning with the initial studies that
confirmed the pathogenicity of cytokines in inflammatory bowel disease, the
development and application of therapeutic antibodies brought challenges and
insights into their potential and optimal use. Infliximab was the first
biological drug approved for use in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The
lessons learned from infliximab include the importance of immunogenicity and the 
influence of pharmacokinetics on disease response and outcomes. Building on this 
foundation, other therapeutic antibodies achieved approval for inflammatory bowel
disease and many more are in development for several digestive diseases. In this 
review, we reflect on the history of therapeutic antibodies and discuss current
practice and future directions for the field.

BACKGROUND: Zinc plays a pivotal role in wound repair, tissue regeneration, and
the immune response. Although zinc deficiency is common in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the impact of low serum zinc levels on disease 
course is not known.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in a prospectively collected IBD registry with at
least 2 serum zinc measurements were included in the analysis. Using a logistic
regression model, rates of IBD-related surgeries, IBD-related hospitalizations,
and IBD-related complications were evaluated after a diagnosis of zinc deficiency
(serum concentration <0.66 μg/mL) compared with those with normal zinc
concentrations. In patients who were zinc deficient, outcomes were also analyzed 
between those who had normalization of zinc levels within 12 months and those who
remained deficient.
RESULTS: A total of 773 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 223 with
ulcerative colitis (UC) were included in the analysis. After adjusting for
covariates, zinc deficiency was associated with an increased risk of subsequent
hospitalizations, surgeries, and disease-related complications in patients with
CD and UC (CD: hospitalizations, odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval
[1.02-2.04]; surgeries, 2.05 [1.38-3.05]; complications, 1.50 [1.04-2.15]; UC:
hospitalizations, 2.14 [1.07-4.29]; surgeries, 1.64 [0.59-4.52]; complications,
1.97 [0.94-4.11]). Normalization of zinc was associated with improvement in these
outcomes in patients with both CD and UC.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD with serum zinc deficiency are more likely to have
adverse disease-specific outcomes. As these outcomes improve with normalization
of zinc, the results from this study support the role for close monitoring and
replacement of zinc in patients with IBD.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays pathogenic roles in renal and
cardiovascular disorders, but whether it is involved in colitis is unclear. Here 
we show that RenTgMK mice that overexpress active renin from the liver developed 
more severe colitis than wild-type controls. More than 50% RenTgMK mice died
whereas all wild-type mice recovered. RenTgMK mice exhibited more robust mucosal 
TH17 and TH1/TH17 responses and more profound colonic epithelial cell apoptosis
compared to wild-type controls. Treatment with aliskiren (a renin inhibitor), but
not hydralazine (a smooth muscle relaxant), ameliorated colitis in RenTgMK mice, 
although both drugs normalized blood pressure. Chronic infusion of angiotensin II
into wild-type mice mimicked the severe colitic phenotype of RenTgMK mice, and
treatment with losartan [an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB)]
ameliorated colitis in wild-type mice, confirming a colitogenic role for the
endogenous RAS. In human biopsies, pro-inflammatory cytokines were suppressed in 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were on ARB therapy compared to
patients not receiving ARB therapy. These observations demonstrate that
activation of the RAS promotes colitis in a blood pressure independent manner.
Angiotensin II appears to drive colonic mucosal inflammation by promoting
intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis and mucosal TH17 responses in colitis
development.

TH17 and TH1/TH17 responses and more profound colonic epithelial cell apoptosis
compared to wild-type controls. Treatment with aliskiren (a renin inhibitor), but
not hydralazine (a smooth muscle relaxant), ameliorated colitis in RenTgMK mice, 
although both drugs normalized blood pressure. Chronic infusion of angiotensin II
into wild-type mice mimicked the severe colitic phenotype of RenTgMK mice, and
treatment with losartan [an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB)]
ameliorated colitis in wild-type mice, confirming a colitogenic role for the
endogenous RAS. In human biopsies, pro-inflammatory cytokines were suppressed in 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were on ARB therapy compared to
patients not receiving ARB therapy. These observations demonstrate that
activation of the RAS promotes colitis in a blood pressure independent manner.

The development of therapeutic antibodies represents a revolutionary change in
medical therapy for digestive diseases. Beginning with the initial studies that
confirmed the pathogenicity of cytokines in inflammatory bowel disease, the
development and application of therapeutic antibodies brought challenges and
insights into their potential and optimal use. Infliximab was the first
biological drug approved for use in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The
lessons learned from infliximab include the importance of immunogenicity and the 
influence of pharmacokinetics on disease response and outcomes. Building on this 
foundation, other therapeutic antibodies achieved approval for inflammatory bowel
disease and many more are in development for several digestive diseases. In this 
review, we reflect on the history of therapeutic antibodies and discuss current
practice and future directions for the field.

BACKGROUND: Zinc plays a pivotal role in wound repair, tissue regeneration, and
the immune response. Although zinc deficiency is common in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the impact of low serum zinc levels on disease 
course is not known.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in a prospectively collected IBD registry with at
least 2 serum zinc measurements were included in the analysis. Using a logistic
regression model, rates of IBD-related surgeries, IBD-related hospitalizations,
and IBD-related complications were evaluated after a diagnosis of zinc deficiency
(serum concentration <0.66 μg/mL) compared with those with normal zinc
concentrations. In patients who were zinc deficient, outcomes were also analyzed 
between those who had normalization of zinc levels within 12 months and those who
remained deficient.
RESULTS: A total of 773 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 223 with
ulcerative colitis (UC) were included in the analysis. After adjusting for
covariates, zinc deficiency was associated with an increased risk of subsequent
hospitalizations, surgeries, and disease-related complications in patients with
CD and UC (CD: hospitalizations, odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval
[1.02-2.04]; surgeries, 2.05 [1.38-3.05]; complications, 1.50 [1.04-2.15]; UC:
hospitalizations, 2.14 [1.07-4.29]; surgeries, 1.64 [0.59-4.52]; complications,
1.97 [0.94-4.11]). Normalization of zinc was associated with improvement in these
outcomes in patients with both CD and UC.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD with serum zinc deficiency are more likely to have
adverse disease-specific outcomes. As these outcomes improve with normalization
of zinc, the results from this study support the role for close monitoring and
replacement of zinc in patients with IBD.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays pathogenic roles in renal and
cardiovascular disorders, but whether it is involved in colitis is unclear. Here 
we show that RenTgMK mice that overexpress active renin from the liver developed 
more severe colitis than wild-type controls. More than 50% RenTgMK mice died
whereas all wild-type mice recovered. RenTgMK mice exhibited more robust mucosal 
TH17 and TH1/TH17 responses and more profound colonic epithelial cell apoptosis
compared to wild-type controls. Treatment with aliskiren (a renin inhibitor), but
not hydralazine (a smooth muscle relaxant), ameliorated colitis in RenTgMK mice, 
although both drugs normalized blood pressure. Chronic infusion of angiotensin II
into wild-type mice mimicked the severe colitic phenotype of RenTgMK mice, and
treatment with losartan [an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB)]
ameliorated colitis in wild-type mice, confirming a colitogenic role for the

BACKGROUND: To simulate the duties and responsibilities of an attending surgeon
and allow senior residents more intraoperative and perioperative autonomy, our
program created a new resident acute care surgery consult service.
METHODS: We structured resident acute care surgery as a new admitting and
inpatient consult service managed by chief and senior residents with attending
supervision. When appropriate, the chief resident served as a teaching assistant 
in the operation. Outcomes were recorded prospectively and reviewed at weekly
quality improvement conferences. The following information was collected: (1)
teaching assistant case logs for senior residents preimplentation (n = 10) and
postimplementation (n = 5) of the resident acute care surgery service; (2) data
on the proportion of each case performed independently by residents; (3) resident
evaluations of the resident acute care surgery versus other general operative
services; (4) consult time for the first 12 months of the service (June 2014 to
June 2015).
RESULTS: During the first year after implementation, the number of total teaching
assistant cases logged among graduating chief residents increased from a mean of 
13.4 ± 13.0 (range 4-44) for preresident acute care surgery residents to
30.8 ± 8.8 (range 27-36) for postresident acute care surgery residents (P < .01).
Of 323 operative cases, the residents performed an average of 82% of the case
independently. There was a significant increase in the satisfaction with the
variety of cases (mean 5.08 vs 4.52, P < .01 on a 6-point Likert scale) and
complexity of cases (mean 5.35 vs 4.94, P < .01) on service evaluations of
resident acute care surgery (n = 27) in comparison with other general operative
services (n = 127). In addition, creation of a 1-team consult service resulted in
a more streamlined consult process with average consult time of 22 minutes for
operative consults and 25 minutes for nonoperative consults (range 5-90 minutes).
CONCLUSION: The implementation of a resident acute care surgery service has
increased resident autonomy, teaching assistant cases, and satisfaction with
operative case variety, as well as the efficiency of operative consultation at
our institution.

OBJECTIVES: Decreased staffing at nighttime is associated with worse outcomes in 
hospitalized patients. Rapid response teams were developed to decrease
preventable harm by providing additional critical care resources to patients with
clinical deterioration. We sought to determine whether rapid response team call
frequency suffers from decreased utilization at night and how this is associated 
with patient outcomes.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected registry database.
SETTING: National registry database of inpatient rapid response team calls.
PATIENTS: Index rapid response team calls occurring on the general wards in the
American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Medical Emergency Team
database between 2005 and 2015 were analyzed.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was inhospital mortality.
Patient and event characteristics between the hours with the highest and lowest
mortality were compared, and multivariable models adjusting for patient
characteristics were fit. A total of 282,710 rapid response team calls from 274
hospitals were included. The lowest frequency of calls occurred in the
consecutive 1 AM to 6:59 AM period, with 266 of 274 (97%) hospitals having lower 
than expected call volumes during those hours. Mortality was highest during the 7
AM hour and lowest during the noon hour (18.8% vs 13.8%; adjusted odds ratio,
1.41 [1.31-1.52]; p < 0.001). Compared with calls at the noon hour, those during 
the 7 AM hour had more deranged vital signs, were more likely to have a
respiratory trigger, and were more likely to have greater than two simultaneous
triggers.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid response team activation is less frequent during the early
morning and is followed by a spike in mortality in the 7 AM hour. These findings 
suggest that failure to rescue deteriorating patients is more common overnight.
Strategies aimed at improving rapid response team utilization during these
vulnerable hours may improve patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Performing advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in the cardiac
catheterization laboratory (CCL) is challenging. Mechanical chest compression
(MCC) devices deliver compressions in a small space, allowing for simultaneous
percutaneous coronary intervention and reduced radiation exposure to rescuers. In
refractory cases, MCC devices allow rescuers to initiate percutaneous mechanical 
circulatory support (MCS) and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) during
resuscitation. This study sought to assess the efficacy and safety of MCC when
compared to manual compressions in the CCL.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who received ACLS in
the CCL at our institution between May 2011 and February 2016. Baseline
characteristics, resuscitation details, and outcomes were compared between
patients who received manual and mechanical compressions.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients (67% male, mean age 58 years) required chest
compressions for cardiac arrest while in the CCL (12 manual and 31 MCC). Patients
receiving MCC were more likely to achieve return of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC) (74% vs. 42%, p=0.05). Of those receiving MCC, twenty-two patients (71%)
were treated with MCS. Patients receiving percutaneous ECLS were more likely to
achieve ROSC (100% vs. 53%, p=0.003) and suffered no episodes of limb loss or
TIMI major bleeding. There were no significant differences in 30-day survival or 
survival to hospital discharge between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of MCC during resuscitation of cardiac arrest in the CCL
increases the rate of ROSC. Simultaneous implantation of MCS, including
percutaneous ECLS, is feasible and safe during MCC-assisted resuscitation in the 
CCL.

Sepsis contributes to up to half of all deaths in hospitalized patients, and
early interventions, such as appropriate antibiotics, have been shown to improve 
outcomes. Most research has focused on early identification and treatment of
patients with sepsis in the ED and the ICU; however, many patients acquire sepsis
on the general wards. The goal of this review is to discuss recent advances in
the detection of sepsis in patients on the hospital wards. We discuss data
highlighting the benefits and limitations of the systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS) criteria for screening patients with sepsis, such as its low
specificity, as well as newly described scoring systems, including the proposed
role of the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score.
Challenges specific to detecting sepsis on the wards are discussed, and future
directions that use big data approaches and automated alert systems are
highlighted.

INTRODUCTION: While atenolol is an effective antihypertensive agent, its use is
also associated with adverse events including hyperglycemia and incident diabetes
that may offset the benefits of blood pressure lowering. By combining metabolomic
and genomic data acquired from hypertensive individuals treated with atenolol, it
may be possible to better understand the pathways that most impact the
development of an adverse glycemic state.
OBJECTIVE: To identify biomarkers that can help predict susceptibility to blood
glucose excursions during exposure to atenolol.
METHODS: Plasma samples acquired from 234 Caucasian participants treated with
atenolol in the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses trial
were analyzed by gas chromatography Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopy.
Metabolomics and genomics data were integrated by first correlating participant's
metabolomic profiles to change in glucose after treatment with atenolol, and then
incorporating genotype information from genes involved in metabolite pathways
associated with glucose response.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that the baseline level of β-alanine was
associated with glucose change after treatment with atenolol (Q = 0.007, β = 2.97
mg/dL). Analysis of genomic data revealed that carriers of the G allele for SNP
rs2669429 in gene DPYS, which codes for dihydropyrimidinase, an enzyme involved
in β-alanine formation, had significantly higher glucose levels after treatment
with atenolol when compared with non-carriers (Q = 0.05, β = 2.76 mg/dL). This
finding was replicated in participants who received atenolol as an add-on therapy
(P = 0.04, β = 1.86 mg/dL).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that β-alanine and rs2669429 may be predictors 
of atenolol-induced hyperglycemia in Caucasian individuals and further
investigation is warranted.

This study aimed to identify novel loci influencing the antihypertensive response
to hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. A genome-wide meta-analysis of blood pressure
(BP) response to hydrochlorothiazide was performed in 1739 white hypertensives
from 6 clinical trials within the International Consortium for Antihypertensive
Pharmacogenomics Studies, making it the largest study to date of its kind. No
signals reached genome-wide significance (P<5×10-8), and the suggestive regions
(P<10-5) were cross-validated in 2 black cohorts treated with
hydrochlorothiazide. In addition, a gene-based analysis was performed on
candidate genes with previous evidence of involvement in diuretic response, in BP
regulation, or in hypertension susceptibility. Using the genome-wide
meta-analysis approach, with validation in blacks, we identified 2 suggestive
regulatory regions linked to gap junction protein α1 gene (GJA1) and forkhead box
A1 gene (FOXA1), relevant for cardiovascular and kidney function. With the
gene-based approach, we identified hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 β-
and steroid δ-isomerase 1 gene (HSD3B1) as significantly associated with BP
response (P<2.28×10-4 ). HSD3B1 encodes the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
enzyme and plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of aldosterone and endogenous
ouabain. By amassing all of the available pharmacogenomic studies of BP response 
to hydrochlorothiazide, and using 2 different analytic approaches, we identified 
3 novel loci influencing BP response to hydrochlorothiazide. The gene-based
analysis, never before applied to pharmacogenomics of antihypertensive drugs to
our knowledge, provided a powerful strategy to identify a locus of interest,
which was not identified in the genome-wide meta-analysis because of high allelic
heterogeneity. These data pave the way for future investigations on new pathways 
and drug targets to enhance the current understanding of personalized
antihypertensive treatment.

Anastomotic leaks represent one of the most alarming complications following any 
gastrointestinal anastomosis due to the substantial effects on post-operative
morbidity and mortality of the patient with long-lasting effects on the
functional and oncologic outcomes. There is a lack of consensus related to the
definition of an anastomotic leak, with a variety of options for prevention and
management. A number of patient-related and technical risk factors have been
found to be associated with the development of an anastomotic leak and have
inspired the development of various preventative measures and technologies. The
International Multispecialty Anastomotic Leak Global Improvement Exchange group
was convened to establish a consensus on the definition of an anastomotic leak as
well as to discuss the various diagnostic, preventative, and management measures 
currently available.

BACKGROUND: Autoantibodies against Factor VIII (FVIII) define the rare but
life-threatening bleeding disorder acquired hemophilia A (AHA). Correction of
FVIII deficiency and eradication of the factor inhibitor are the ultimate
therapeutic goals in this disorder. Bypassing agents such as recombinant factor
VIIa (rFVIIa) or FVIII inhibitor bypassing agent are often used to control
coagulopathy before the inhibitor is eradicated. Bypassing agents carry a risk of
thrombosis, however.
CASE REPORT: We report a patient with newly diagnosed AHA and thalamic bleed who 
additionally had active atrial fibrillation and developed a segmental pulmonary
embolism, limiting tolerable rFVIIa dosage. This patient with very-high-risk
brain bleed and concurrent thrombosis on bypass agent represented a significant
management dilemma for which we successfully utilized therapeutic plasma exchange
(TPE) to reduce the inhibitor titer.
RESULTS: FVIII inhibitor was undetectable and FVIII level was above the lower
limit of normal within 12.5 days from starting TPE. While the patient ultimately 
died 24 days from admission for reasons unrelated to bleeding, his intracerebral 
hemorrhage was unchanged in size and no other bleeding morbidity was observed.
CONCLUSION: This patient achieved eradication of FVIII inhibitor and did not have
bleed expansion while receiving multimodal therapy including corticosteroids,
rituximab, and TPE. We discuss the periprocedural risks of TPE in an acquired
hemophilia patient and our multiteam management of that risk.

OBJECTIVE: In lupus nephritis, tubulointerstitial inflammation (TII) is
associated with in situ adaptive immune cell networks that amplify local tissue
damage. Since conventional therapy appears ineffective for severe TII, and these 
patients often progress to renal failure, understanding in situ mechanisms might 
reveal new therapeutic targets. This study was undertaken to assess whether
dysregulated apoptotic regulators maintain local adaptive immunity and drive
inflammation in TII.
METHODS: This study utilized novel computational approaches that, when applied to
multicolor confocal images, quantified apoptotic regulator protein expression in 
selected lymphocyte subsets. This approach was validated using laser-capture
microdissection (LCM) coupled to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
Furthermore, the consequences of dysregulated apoptotic mediator expression were 
explored in a murine model of lupus nephritis.
RESULTS: Analyses of renal biopsy tissue from patients with lupus nephritis and
those with mixed cellular renal allograft rejection revealed that the B cell
lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) was frequently expressed in infiltrating lymphocytes, 
whereas expression of myeloid cell leukemia 1 was low. In contrast, the
reciprocal pattern of expression was observed in tonsil germinal centers. These
results were consistent with RNA expression data obtained using LCM and qPCR.
Bcl-2 was also highly expressed in tubulointerstitial infiltrates in (NZB ×
NZW)F1 (NZB/NZW) mice. Furthermore, treatment of NZB/NZW mice with ABT-199, a
selective oral inhibitor of Bcl-2, prolonged survival and prevented proteinuria
and development of TII in a lupus prevention model. Interestingly, glomerular
immune complexes were partially ameliorated by ABT-199 treatment, and serum
anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titers were unaffected.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an attractive therapeutic target
in patients with lupus nephritis who manifest TII.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal tissues of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) contain
expanded populations of T cells which are believed to mediate inflammation. We
performed a detailed characterization of these T-cell repertoires.
METHODS: We obtained biopsies from the neoterminal ileum of 12 patients
undergoing evaluation for postoperative recurrent CD and 4 individuals with
normal terminal ileum and no history of inflammatory bowel disease (controls).
Samples of diseased terminal ileum were obtained from 5 patients undergoing
surgery for stricturing or penetrating CD. Total RNA was extracted from tissues
and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and cDNAs were generated. We used
next-generation sequencing to characterize T-cell receptor (TCR)-α and TCR-β
cDNAs in ileal mucosal tissue and matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells of
17 patients with CD to identify oligoclonal expansions of T-cell populations
associated with CD.
RESULTS: TCR diversity in mucosal tissue was significantly lower than that of
matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating expansion of certain
T-cell populations in inflamed intestinal tissue. A single TCR-β clonotype,
CASSWTNGEQYF (TRBV10-1-TRBJ2-7), was enriched at a frequency of 7.0% to 28.9% in 
the neoterminal ileum of 4 of 12 patients with recurrent CD. The abundance of
this clonotype significantly correlated with the severity of disease recurrence, 
based on Rutgeerts score (P = 0.015).
CONCLUSIONS: Specific populations of T cells are expanded in the inflamed
intestinal mucosa of patients with CD; their abundance correlates with severity
of disease recurrence. Studies of these T cells could provide information about
mechanisms of CD pathogenesis. Deep TCR sequencing is a powerful tool that
rapidly provides in-depth, real-time assessment of the T-cell repertoire.

Hereditary hematologic malignancy (HM) syndromes are increasingly recognized as
causative of adult hematopoietic cancers, and the advent of next-generation
sequencing has accelerated the discovery of new syndromes based on dense
clustering of these diseases in particular families. Updated classifications
schemes for myeloid malignancies will now include recommendations for taking a
family history on all patients diagnosed with hematopoietic malignancies and for 
genetic counseling and testing of appropriate individuals and families.
Therefore, now more than ever, clinicians and pathologists will need to have a
high index of suspicion and be familiar with the aspects of a patient's personal 
or family history that should raise suspicion regarding these syndromes as well
as the options for clinical testing. Whenever possible, individuals should be
tested with certified, clinical platforms that can detect both point mutations
and genomic rearrangements that disrupt gene function so that results are
immediately actionable. Individuals and families who test negative for mutations 
in the known germline predisposition genes serve as important sources of
discovery for new inherited susceptibility syndromes.

Analysis of the clinical characteristics of hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HSCT) donors has proven beneficial for identifying cases of heritable
hematopoietic disorders. This study examines poor peripheral blood hematopoietic 
stem cell mobilization after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration
among 328 donors as a potential marker for suspected familial predisposition to
myeloid malignancies. Here, we present data comparing the clinical
characteristics of poor-mobilizing versus nonpoor-mobilizing donors and the
results of panel-based sequencing of hematopoietic genes in poor-mobilizing
donors. From this analysis, we identified a novel case of a donor-derived
myelodysplastic syndrome in an HSCT recipient that is consistent with clonal
evolution of TET2-mutated clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) 
within the donor. This study demonstrates the potential risk of using
hematopoietic stem cells from a donor with CHIP and raises the question of
whether there should be increased screening measures to identify such donors.

INTRODUCTION: Although multiple predispositions to hematologic malignancies
exist, evaluations for hereditary cancer syndromes (HCS) are underperformed by
most hematologist/oncologists. Criteria for initiating HCS evaluation are poorly 
defined, and results of genetic testing for hereditary hematologic malignancies
have not been systematically reported.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 2014 to August 2015, 67 patients were referred
to the Hereditary Hematologic Malignancy Clinic (HHMC). Referral reasons included
(1) bone marrow failure or myelodysplastic syndrome in patients ≤ 50 years, (2)
evaluation for germ-line inheritance of identified RUNX1, GATA2, or CEBPA
mutations on targeted next-generation sequencing panels, and (3) strong personal 
and/or family history of malignancy. Cultured skin fibroblasts were utilized for 
germ-line DNA in all patients with hematologic malignancy.
RESULTS: Eight patients (12%) were clinically diagnosed with a HCS: 4 patients
with RUNX1-related familial platelet disorder (FPD)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
and 1 patient each with dyskeratosis congenita, Fanconi anemia, germ-line DDX41, 
and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Two patients with concern for FPD/AML and LFS,
respectively, had RUNX1 and TP53 variants of unknown significance. Additionally, 
4 patients with prior HCS diagnosis (1 LFS, 3 FPD/AML) were referred for further 
evaluation and surveillance.
CONCLUSION: In this HHMC-referred hematologic malignancy cohort, HCS was
confirmed in 12 patients (18%). HCS identification provides insight for improved 
and individualized treatment, as well as screening/surveillance opportunities for
family members. The HHMC has facilitated HCS diagnosis; with increased clinical
awareness of hematologic malignancy predisposition syndromes, more patients who
may benefit from evaluation can be identified. Mutation panels intended for
prognostication may provide increased clinical suspicion for germ-line testing.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to test the feasibility and accuracy of an
automated algorithm that simultaneously quantifies 3-dimensional (3D)
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)-derived left atrial (LA) and left
ventricular (LV) volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
Conventional manual 3D TTE tracings and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images
were used as a reference for comparison.
BACKGROUND: Cardiac chamber quantification from 3D TTE is superior to 2D TTE
measurements. However, integration of 3D quantification into clinical practice
has been limited by time-consuming workflow and the need for 3D expertise. A
novel automated software was developed that provides LV and LA volumetric
quantification from 3D TTE datasets that reflect real-life manual 3-dimensional
echocardiography measurements and values comparable to CMR.
METHODS: A total of 159 patients were studied in 2 separate protocols. In
protocol 1, 94 patients underwent 3D TTE imaging (EPIQ, iE33, X5-1, Philips
Healthcare, Andover, Massachusetts) covering the left atrium and left ventricle. 
LA and LV volumes and LVEF were obtained using the automated software
(HeartModel, Philips Healthcare) with and without contour correction, and
compared with the averaged manual 3D volumetric measurements from 3 readers. In
protocol 2, automated measurements from 65 patients were compared with a CMR
reference. The Pearson correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analysis, and paired
Student t tests were used to assess inter-technique agreement.
RESULTS: Correlations between the automated and manual 3D TTE measurements were
strong (r = 0.87 to 0.96). LVEF was underestimated and automated LV
end-diastolic, LV end-systolic, and LA volumes were overestimated compared with
manual measurements. Agreement between the automated analysis and CMR was also
strong (r = 0.84 to 0.95). Test-retest variability was low.
CONCLUSIONS: Automated simultaneous quantification of LA and LV volumes and LVEF 
is feasible and requires minimal 3D software analysis training. The automated
measurements are not only comparable to manual measurements but also to CMR. This
technique is highly reproducible and timesaving, and it therefore promises to
facilitate the integration of 3D TTE-based left-heart chamber quantification into
clinical practice.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are associated with subclinical changes
in cardiac function. Although the mechanism underlying this finding is unknown,
elevated levels of soluble antiangiogenic proteins such as soluble fms-like
tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1) and soluble endoglin (sEng) are associated with
myocardial dysfunction and may play a role. We hypothesized that these
antiangiogenic proteins may contribute to the development of cardiac dysfunction 
in HDP. We prospectively studied 207 pregnant women with HDP and nonhypertensive 
controls and evaluated whether changes in global longitudinal strain (GLS)
observed on echocardiography is specific for HDP and whether these changes
correlate with HDP biomarkers, sFlt1 and sEng. A total of 62 (30%) patients were 
diagnosed with preeclampsia (group A), 105 (51%) did not have an HDP (group B),
and 40 (19%) were diagnosed with chronic or gestational hypertension (group C).
Blood was drawn and sFlt1 and sEng levels measured using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. Comprehensive echocardiograms, including measurement of GLS,
were performed on all patients. Overall, GLS was worse in women in group A
(preeclampsia) than those in group B or C. Increasing sFlt1 and sEng levels
correlated with worsening GLS (r=0.44 for sFlt1 and r=0.46 for sEng, both
P<0.001), which remained significant after multivariable analysis (r=0.18 and
r=0.22, both P≤0.01). Increasing levels also correlated with increasing left
ventricular mass index, which also remained significant after multivariable
analysis (r=0.20 for sFlt1 and 0.19 for sEng, both P=0.01). Elevated circulating 
levels of antiangiogenic proteins in HDP correlate with and may contribute to
myocardial dysfunction as measured by GLS.

OBJECTIVE: We compared the real-world effectiveness of initiating adalimumab and 
infliximab among patients in the US who were naïve to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
inhibitors.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted to evaluate the real-world
effectiveness among adults with ulcerative colitis (UC) initiating adalimumab or 
infliximab. Charts of patients with UC were abstracted by treating physicians
(randomly selected from a nationally representative panel) in April 2014. Patient
eligibility criteria included: adalimumab or infliximab initiation on/after 1
October 2012; no prior anti-TNF therapy, history of Crohn's disease, or
colectomy; and ≥6 months of follow-up. Information on clinical outcomes (partial 
Mayo score, remission rate, physician global assessment (PGA), stool frequency,
and rectal bleeding) and treatment patterns (dose escalations, discontinuations, 
switches, and treatment augmentations) were retrospectively reported by treating 
physicians. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression models were used to assess the time to clinical outcomes and treatment
changes for each therapy.
RESULTS: Overall, 170 physicians participated, contributing data on 380 and 424
patients who initiated adalimumab and infliximab, respectively. Baseline clinical
characteristics were similar between groups. Both adalimumab- and
infliximab-treated patients showed substantial improvements from baseline to
follow-up in effectiveness measures; results of these measures were similar
between the adalimumab and infliximab cohorts. Time to remission (p = 0.5241), no
rectal bleeding (p = 0.7648), normal stool count (p = 0.9941), and normal PGA
(p = 0.7697) showed no significant differences between therapies in unadjusted
and adjusted comparisons. Unadjusted and adjusted time to event analysis of
discontinuation (p = 0.7151), dose escalation (p = 0.6310), treatment
augmentation (p = 0.1209), and switching (p = 0.7975) showed no significant
differences between the two cohorts.
LIMITATIONS: Retrospective, observational design.
CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab and infliximab were similarly effective in the treatment 
of moderate-to-severe UC in the real-world clinical setting.
